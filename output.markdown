## Introduction
It has long been a common practice to incorporate the works of earlier writers into new books. Indeed, many commonplace books consist of nothing _but_ quotations and similar notes. We have many surviving examples from the Roman Empire, such as Aulus Gellius' _Attic Nights_. These texts were not always attributed to the original source. Lacking the modern concept of plagiarism (and our post-printing-press system of uniform citations) writers sometimes come off as careless to modern sensibilities. Quotes could be paraphrased and rather vague citations were the norm. Indeed, some authors committed a kind of reverse plagiarism, [pseudepigraphically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigrapha) attributing their work to an earlier, more famous author.
 
In a way, this reuse is fortunate: many texts from the Classical period only exist in fragments quoted in other documents. Some works survive in [epitome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome), distilled versions that summarized the text; for others we have fragments that later writers quoted or abridged as they wrote their compilations.

Artists, of course, have been far looser with their borrowings than writers of mere facts, placing the present work solidly within a long tradition. The closest literary ancedents of NaNoGenMo--Dada and Oulipo--have often explored similar sampling approaches. Kathryn Hume has suggested that technical constratints have lead NaNoGenMo to "align itself with poetics of recontextualization and reassembly." While I'd point out that NaNoGenMo also exhibits other aspects, such as the concrete poetry in thricedotted's _The Seeker_, or the way structurally-plotted works like _Hannah and The Twelve-Disk Tower of Hanoi_ evoke the chessboard constraints of _Life a User's Manual_ or _Through the Looking Glass_, there is an undeniable strand of appropreation as we teach our machines to imitate their human creators. Still, that's no reason to neglect giving credit, so this book attempts to cite the sources for the texts it borrows.

In this work, that deliberate borrowing is the intent. Unlike an age of precious codices, the information age is a time of entirely too much to read. Search engines can find anything you ask for but, like a fairy-tale mirror, can only answer the questions you know enough to ask in the first place. The serendipity of browsing through a library is lost. Extracting the stories and arranging them in a new pattern presents a new angle. Rather than an exhaustive view of the forest, it picks out one or two trees you might have otherwise overlooked.

I chose Virgil as the protagonist for three reasons: first, his works are among the source texts in the Perseus Digital Library used for much of the text here. His _Aeneid_ builds on earlier traditions, recast in a founding epic for a new age: appropriate for a work themed around appropriation and reuse in this new information age. This would not be enough to recommend him on its own: there are other authors whose works were much closer to the kind of copying and summarizing going on here. And _The Golden Ass_ by Apuleius, one of the earliest surviving novels, is closer in form to the travel tale that structures this generated novel. But there was also a tradition that linked Virgil and his poetry with magic and prophecy. It was no accident that Dante chose Virgil to be his guide through the _Inferno_. Lastly, that tradition of magic lead the much-neglected Avram Davidson to pen a novel with Vergil Magus as the magician-protagonist. My own pseudo-Virgil is a humble tribute, a machine homunculus librarian to forgotten texts.

### A story by Titus Livius (Livy) about Roma from The History of Rome, Book 1



There^[The Combat of the Horatii and Curiatii.] happened to be in each of the armies a triplet of brothers, fairly matched in years and strength. It is generally agreed that they were called Horatii and Curiatii. Few incidents in antiquity have been more widely celebrated, yet in spite of its celebrity there is a discrepancy in the accounts as to which nation each belonged. There are authorities on both sides, but I find that the majority give the name of Horatii to the Romans, and my sympathies lead me to follow them.

The kings suggested to them that they should each fight on behalf of their country, and where victory rested, there should be the sovereignty. They raised no objection; so the time and place were fixed. But before they engaged a treaty was concluded between the Romans and the Albans, providing that the nation whose representatives proved victorious should receive the peaceable submission of the other.

This is the earliest treaty recorded, and as all treaties, however different the conditions they contain, are concluded with the same forms, I will describe the forms with which this one was concluded as handed down by tradition. The Fetial put the formal question to Tullus: "Do you, King, order me to make a treaty with the _Pater Patratus_ of the Alban nation?" On the king replying in the affirmative, the Fetial said: "I demand of thee, King, some tufts of grass." The king replied: "Take those that are pure." The Fetial brought pure grass from the Citadel. Then he asked the king: "Do you constitute me the plenipotentiary of the People of Rome, the Quirites, sanctioning also my vessels and comrades?" To which the king replied: "So far as may be without hurt to myself and the People of Rome, the Quirites, I do." The Fetial was M. Valerius. He made Spurius Furius the Pater Patratus by touching his head and hair with the grass. Then the Pater Patratus, who is constituted for the purpose of giving the treaty the religious sanction of an oath, did so by a long formula in verse, which it is not worth while to quote. After reciting the conditions he said: "Hear, 0 Jupiter, hear! thou Pater Patratus of the people of Alba! Hear ye, too, people of Alba! As these conditions have been publicly rehearsed from first to last, from these tablets, in perfect good faith, and inasmuch as they have here and now been most clearly understood, so these conditions the People of Rome will not be the first to go back from. If they shall, in their national council, with false and malicious intent be the first to go back, then do thou, Jupiter, on that day, so smite the People of Rome, even as I here and now shall smite this swine, and smite them so much the more heavily, as thou art greater in power and might." With these words he struck the swine with a flint. In similar wise the Albans recited their oath and formularies through their own dictator and their priests.[^69c43475e8f449d59917f8d6def2c196]

### A story by Polybius about Roma from Histories



It was in the nineteenth year after the sea-fight at^[B. C. 387-386. The rise of the Roman dominion may be traced from the retirement of the Gauls from the city. From that time one nation after another in Italy fell into their hands.] Aegospotami, and the sixteenth before the battle at Leuctra; the year in which the Lacedaemonians made what is called the Peace of Antalcidas with the King of Persia; the year in which the elder Dionysius was besieging Rhegium after beating the Italian Greeks on the river Elleporus; and in which the Gauls took Rome itself by storm and were occupying the whole of it except the Capitol. With these Gauls the Romans made a treaty and settlement which they were content to accept: and having thus become beyond all expectation once more masters of their own country, they made a start in their career of expansion; and in the succeeding period engaged in various wars with their neighbours.^[The Latini.] First, by dint of valour, and the good fortune which attended them in the field, they mastered all the Latini; then they went to war with the Etruscans; then with the Celts; and next with the Samnites, who lived on the eastern and northern frontiers of Latium.^[The Etruscans, Gauls, and Samnites.] Some time after this the Tarentines insulted the ambassadors of Rome, and, in fear of the consequences, invited and obtained the assistance of Pyrrhus.^[Pyrrhus, B. C. 280.] This happened in the year before the Gauls invaded Greece, some of whom perished near Delphi, while others crossed into Asia. Then it was that the Romans—having reduced the Etruscans and Samnites to obedience, and conquered the Italian Celts in many battles—attempted for the first time the reduction of the rest of Italy.^[Southern Italy.] The nations for whose possessions they were about to fight they affected to regard, not in the light of foreigners, but as already for the most part belonging and pertaining to themselves. The experience gained from their contests with the Samnites and the Celts had served as a genuine training in the art of war.^[Pyrrhus finally quits Italy, B. C. 274.] Accordingly, they entered upon the war with spirit, drove Pyrrhus from Italy, and then undertook to fight with and subdue those who had taken part with him. They succeeded everywhere to a marvel, and reduced to obedience all the tribes inhabiting Italy except the Celts; after which they undertook to besiege some of their own citizens, who at that time were occupying Rhegium.[^0ad17d340aa945338c332f3b3e5889f3]

### A story by Polybius about Tibur from Histories



After this one would naturally be inclined to ask what part is left for the people in the constitution, when the Senate has these various functions, especially the control of the receipts and expenditure of the exchequer; and when the Consuls, again, have absolute power over the details of military preparation, and an absolute authority in the field? There is, however, a part left the people, and it is a most important one. For the people is the sole fountain of honour and of punishment; and it is by these two things and these alone that dynasties and constitutions and, in a word, human society are held together: for where the distinction between them is not sharply drawn both in theory and practice, there no undertaking can be properly administered,—as indeed we might expect when good and bad are held in exactly the same honour. The people then are the only court to decide matters of life and death; and even in-cases where the penalty is money, if the sum to be assessed is sufficiently serious, and especially when the accused have held the higher magistracies. And in regard to this arrangement there is one point deserving especial commendation and record. Men who are on trial for their lives at Rome, while sentence is in process of being voted,—if even only one of the tribes whose votes are needed to ratify the sentence has not voted,—have the privilege at Rome of openly departing and condemning themselves to a voluntary exile. Such men are safe at Naples or Praeneste or at Tibur, and at other towns with which this arrangement has been duly ratified on oath.

Again, it is the people who bestow offices on the deserving, which are the most honourable rewards of virtue. It has also the absolute power of passing or repealing laws; and, most important of all, it is the people who deliberate on the question of peace or war. And when provisional terms are made for alliance, suspension of hostilities, or treaties, it is the people who ratify them or the reverse.

These considerations again would lead one to say that the chief power in the state was the people's, and that the constitution was a democracy.[^cac5fe64cbfd47699de63530be0f1425]

### A story by Virgil about Tibur from Aeneid



A solemn custom was observ'd of old,  
Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,  
Their standard when in fighting fields they rear  
Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare  
The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;  
Or from the boasting Parthians would regain  
Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.  
Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,  
And still are worship'd with religious fear)  
Before his temple stand: the dire abode,  
And the fear'd issues of the furious god,  
Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,  
The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.  
Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,  
The Roman consul their decree declares,  
And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.  
The youth in military shouts arise,  
And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.  
These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,  
Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,  
Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar  
Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;  
But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,  
Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.  
Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:  
At her approach the brazen hinges fly;  
The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;  
And, like a tempest, issues out the war.  
  
The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,  
Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,  
Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,  
Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;  
Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,  
And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry.  
Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part  
New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:  
With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,  
And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.  
Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,  
Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,  
Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:  
All these of old were places of renown.  
Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;  
Some twine young sallows to support the shield;  
The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold,  
With silver plated, and with ductile gold.  
The rustic honors of the scythe and share  
Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.  
Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires;  
The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.  
The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace  
The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.  
The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;  
The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Tibur from Caligula



He completed the works which were left unfinished by Tiberius, namely, the temple of Augustus, and the theatre of Pompey.^[See TIBERIUS, c. xlvii. and AUGUSTUS, c. xxxi.] He began, likewise, the aqueduct from the neighbourhood of Tibur,^[This aqueduct, commenced by Caligula and completed by Claudian, a truly imperial work, conveyed the waters of two streams to Rome, following the valley of the Anio from above Tivoli. The course of one of these rivulets was forty miles, and it was carried on arches, immediately after quitting its source, for a distance of three miles. The other, the Anio Novus, also began on arches, which continued for upwards of twelve miles. After this, both were conveyed under ground; but at the distance of six miles from the city, they were united, and carried upon arches all the rest of the way. This is the most perfect of all the ancient aqueducts; and it has been repaired, so as to convey the Acqua Felice, one of the three streams which now supply Rome. See CLAUDIUS, c. XX. ] and an amphitheatre near the Septa;^[By Septa, Suetonius here means the huts or barracks of the pretorian camp, which was a permanent and fortified station. It stood to the east of the Viminal and Quirinal hills, between the present Porta Pia and S. Lorenzo, where these is a quadrangular projection in the city walls marking the site. The remains of the Amphitheatrum Castrense stand between the Porta Maggiore and S. Giovanni, formerly without the ancient walls, but now included in the line. It is all of brick, even the Corinthian pillars, and seems to have been but a rude structure, suited to the purpose for which it was built, the amusement of the soldiers, and gymnastic exercises. For this purpose they were used to construct temporary amphitheatres near the stations in the distant provinces, which were not built of stone or brick, but hollow circular spots dug in the ground, round which the spectators sat on the declivity, on ranges of seats cut in the sod. Many vestiges of this kind have been traced in Britain. ] of which works, one was completed by his successor Claudius, and the other remained as he left it. The walls of Syracuse, which had fallen to decay by length of time, he repaired, as he likewise did the temples of the gods. He formed plans for rebuilding the palace of Polycrates at Samos, finishing the temple of the Didymaean Apollo at Miletus, and building a town on a ridge of the Alps; but, above all, for cutting through the isthmus in Achaia^[The Isthmus of Corinth; an enterprize which had formerly been attempted by Demetrius, and which was also projected by Julius Caesar, c. xliv., and Nero, c. xix.; but they all failed of accomplishing it.] and even sent a centurion of the first rank to measure out the work.[^7fc581ce60d046c4be1b242b1d67c960]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Roma from Philippics



Therefore, if when we have received those men we can still be free, let us subdue our hatred to them, and endure peace; but if there can be no tranquillity while those men are in safety, then let us rejoice that an opportunity of fighting them is put in our power. For so, either (these men being conquered) we shall enjoy the republic victorious, or, if we be defeated, (but may Jupiter avert that disaster), we shall live, if not with an actual breath, at all events in the renown of our valor.[^6ba5770d575e47faae5dfca73ce598c8]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Tibur from Philippics



Marcus Lepidus is desirous of peace. He does well especially if he can make such a peace as he made lately, owing to which the republic will behold the son of Cnaeus Pompeius, and will receive him in her bosom and embrace; and will think, that not he alone, but that she also is restored to herself with him. This was the reason why you decreed to him a statue in the rostra with an honorable inscription, and why you voted him a triumph in his absence. For although he had performed great exploits in war, and such as well deserved a triumph, still for that he might not have had that given to him which was not given to Lucius Aemilius, nor to Aemilianus Scipio, nor to the former Africanus, nor to Marius, nor to Pompeius, who had the conduct of greater wars than he had, but because he had put an end to a civil war in perfect silence, the first moment that it was in his power, on that account you conferred on him the greatest honors.[^1a6dbdf85c8b43cf89db4255262069f0]

### A story by Julius Caesar about Corfinium from Civil War



Pompey, having intelligence of what passed at Corfinium, retreated from Luceria to Canusium, and from thence to Brundusium. He ordered all the new levies to join him, armed the shepherds and slaves, furnished them with horses, and formed a body of about three hundred cavalry. Meanwhile the pretor L. Manlius flying from Alba, with six cohorts; and the pretor Rutilus Lupus, from Tarracina, with three; saw Caesar's cavalry at a distance, commanded by Bivius Curius: upon which, the soldiers immediately abandoned the two pretors, and joined the troops under the conduct of Curius. Several other parties, flying different ways, fell in, some with the foot,otherswith the horse. Cn. Magius of Cremona, Pompey's chief engineer, being taken on his way to Brundusium, was brought to Caesar, who sent him back to Pompey with this message: "That as he had not yet obtained an interview, his design was to come to Brundusium, there to confer with him in relation to the common safety; because they soon would be able to despatch, in a personal treaty, what, if managed by the intervention of others, could not be hindered from running into a tedious negotiation."[^455363dd37174a5fb1b722f0018017a3]

Caesar having made himself master of Asculum, and obliged Lentulus to retire, ordered the soldiers who had deserted him, to be sought after, and new levies to be made. He remained only one day there, to settle what related to provisions, and then pursued his march to Corfinium. Upon his arrival there, he found five cohorts, whom Domitius had detached from the garrison, employed in breaking down a bridge about three miles distant from the town. But Caesar's advanced parties attacking them, they quickly abandoned the bridge, and retired to Corfinium. Caesar having passed with his legions, halted before the town, and encamped under the walls.[^681ba539a1f646c58e30827f24c64c4c]

Oppianicus began to entreat the man to show him some method of corrupting the tribunal But he, as was afterwards heard from Oppianicus himself, said that there was no one in the city except himself who could do this. But at first he began to make objections, because he said that he was a candidate for the aedileship with men of the highest rank, and that he was afraid of incurring unpopularity and of giving offence. Afterwards, being prevailed on, he required at first a large sum of money. At last, he came down to what could be managed, and desired six hundred and forty thousand sesterces to be sent to his house. And as soon as this money was brought to him, that most worthless man immediately began to form and adopt the following idea,—that nothing could be more advantageous for his interests than for Oppianicus to be condemned; because, if he were acquitted, he must either distribute the money among the judges, or else restore it to him: but if he were condemned, there would be no one to reclaim it.[^6675bd16779c444097536e089fd5ec2e]

### A story by Horace about Tibur from Odes



Come down, Calliope, from above:  
Breathe on the pipe a strain of fire:  
Or if a graver note thou love,  
With Phoebus' cittern and his lyre.  
You hear her? or is this the play  
Of fond illusion? Hark! meseems  
Through gardens of the good I stray,  
'Mid murmuring gales and purling streams.  
Me, as I lay on Vultur's steep,  
A truant past Apulia's bound,  
O'ertired, poor child, with play and sleep,  
With living green the stock-doves crown'd—  
A legend, nay, a miracle,  
By Acherontia's nestlings told,  
By all in Bantine glade that dwell,  
Or till the rich Forentan mould.  
"Bears, vipers, spared him as he lay,  
The sacred garland deck'd his hair,  
The myrtle blended with the bay:  
The child's inspired: the gods were there."  
Your grace, sweet Muses, shields me still  
On Sabine heights, or lets me range  
Where cool Praeneste, Tibur's hill,  
Or liquid Baiae proffers change.  
Me to your springs, your dances true,  
Philippi bore not to the ground,  
Nor the doom'd tree in falling slew,  
Nor billowy Palinurus drown'd.  
Grant me your presence, blithe and fain  
Mad Bosporus shall my bark explore;  
My foot shall tread the sandy plain  
That glows beside Assyria's shore;  
'Mid Briton tribes, the stranger's foe,  
And Spaniards, drunk with horses' blood,  
And quiver'd Scythians, will I go  
Unharm'd, and look on Tanais' flood.  
When Caesar's self in peaceful town  
The weary veteran's home has made,  
You bid him lay his helmet down  
And rest in your Pierian shade.  
Mild thoughts you plant, and joy to see  
Mild thoughts take root. The nations know  
How with descending thunder he  
The impious Titans hurl'd below,  
Who rules dull earth and stormy seas,  
And towns of men, and realms of pain,  
And gods, and mortal companies,  
Alone, impartial in his reign.  
Yet Jove had fear'd the giant rush,  
Their upraised arms, their port of pride,  
And the twin brethren bent to push  
Huge Pelion up Olympus' side.  
But Typhon, Mimas, what could these,  
Or what Porphyrion's stalwart scorn,  
Rhoetus, or he whose spears were trees,  
Enceladus, from earth uptorn,  
As on they rush'd in mad career  
'Gainst Pallas' shield? Here met the foe  
Fierce Vulcan, queenly Juno here,  
And he who ne'er shall quit his bow,  
Who laves in clear Castalian flood  
His locks, and loves the leafy growth  
Of Lycia next his native wood,  
The Delian and the Pataran both.  
Strength, mindless, falls by its own weight;  
Strength, mix'd with mind, is made more strong  
By the just gods, who surely hate  
The strength whose thoughts are set on wrong.  
Let hundred-handed Gyas bear  
His witness, and Orion known  
Tempter of Dian, chaste and fair,  
By Dian's maiden dart o'erthrown.  
Hurl'd on the monstrous shapes she bred,  
Earth groans, and mourns her children thrust  
To Orcus; Aetna's weight of lead  
Keeps down the fire that breaks its crust;  
Still sits the bird on Tityos' breast,  
The warder of Unlawful love;

### A story by Titus Livius (Livy) about Roma from The History of Rome, Book 1



There^[Numa Pompilius elected King.] was living, in those days, at Cures, a Sabine city, a man of renowned justice and piety-Numa Pompilius. He was as conversant as any one in that age could be with all divine and human law. His master is given as Pythagoras of Samos, as tradition speaks of no other. But this is erroneous, for it is generally agreed that it was more than a century later, in the reign of Servius Tullius, that Pythagoras gathered round him crowds of eager students, in the most distant part of Italy, in the neighbourhood of Metapontum, Heraclea, and Crotona. Now, even if he had been contemporary with Numa, how could his reputation have reached the Sabines? From what places, and in what common language could he have induced any one to become his disciple? Who could have guaranteed the safety of a solitary individual travelling through so many nations differing in speech and character? I believe rather that Numa's virtues were the result of his native temperament and self-training, moulded not so much by foreign influences as by the rigorous and austere discipline of the ancient Sabines, which was the purest type of any that existed in the old days.

When Numa's name was mentioned, though the Roman senators saw that the balance of power would be on the side of the Sabines if the king were chosen from amongst them, still no one ventured to propose a partisan of his own, or any senator, or citizen in preference to him. Accordingly they all to a man decreed that the crown should be offered to Numa Pompilius. He was invited to Rome, and following the precedent set by Romulus, when he obtained his crown through the augury which sanctioned the founding of the City, Numa ordered that in his case also the gods should be consulted. He was solemnly conducted by an augur, who was afterwards honoured by being made a State functionary for life, to the Citadel, and took his seat on a stone facing south. The augur seated himself on his left hand, with his head covered, and holding in his right hand a curved staff without any knots, which they called a "_lituus_." After surveying the prospect over the City and surrounding country, he offered prayers and marked out the heavenly regions by an imaginary line from east to west; the southern he defined as "the right hand," the northern as "the left hand." He then fixed upon an object, as far as he could see, as a corresponding mark, and then transferring the lituus to his left hand, he laid his right upon Numa's head and offered this prayer: "Father Jupiter, if it be heaven's will that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be king of Rome, do thou signify it to us by sure signs within those boundaries which I have traced." Then he described in the usual formula the augury which he desired should be sent. They were sent, and Numa being by them manifested to be king, came down from the "_templum_."^[_templum_ —In taking auspices, the augur or magistrate marked out a rectangular space by noting certain objects, trees or what not, within which the desired signs were to appear, and tracing a corresponding area mentally in the sky. The spot where he took his station, the _auguraculum_, was also a small rectangular space; each of these was called a templum. All important magisterial acts were preceded by auspices, and the word templum was extended to denote the position occupied by the magistrate, such as the senate-house, the platform from which the Assembly was addressed, etc.][^e94d27eba9ad4d9ba0ebc25199aed8d3]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Ostia/Portus from For Sestius



But that, forsooth, did seem like a fortune appointed for the republic by fate itself, that that blind and senseless tribune of the people should find two—must I call them consuls? must I honour by this name the overthrowers of this empire, the betrayers of your dignity, the enemies of all good men? men who thought that they had been adorned with those _fasces_, and with all the other insignia of supreme honour and command, for the purpose of destroying the senate, of crushing the equestrian order, and extinguishing all the rights and established principles of our ancestors. And, I beg you in the name of the immortal gods, if you do not yet wish to recall their wickedness and the wounds which they have burnt into the republic, still turn your recollection to their countenances and their gait. Their actions will more easily present themselves to your minds if you bring their faces before your eyes.[^8cdecf9e99c64371b66e3d85c90b58c9]

as they live in an island remote from any people to corrupt them. Also the remedy which they employ for this defect^[i.e. the defect of the undue restriction of the office.] is a curious one, and less characteristic of a republic than of a dynasty^[See 1292b 10 n.]: often the Cosmi are expelled by a conspiracy formed among some of their actual colleagues or the private citizens. Also the Cosmi are allowed to resign during their term of office. Now it would be preferable for all these expedients to be put in force by law rather than at the discretion of individuals, for that is a dangerous principle. And the worst expedient of all is that of the suspension of the office of Cosmi, which is often brought about by members of the powerful class who wish to escape being punished; this proves that the constitution has a republican element, although it is not actually a republic but rather a dynasty.^[See 1292b 10 n.] And the nobles frequently form parties among the common people and among their friends and so bring about a suspension of government,^[The MSS. give 'bring about a monarchy.'] and form factions and engage in war with one another. Yet such a state of things is virtually the same as if for a period of time the state underwent an entire revolution, and the bonds of civil society were loosened.And it is a precarious position for a state to be in, when those who wish to attack it also have the power to do so. But, as has been said, it is saved by its locality; for distance has had the same effect as alien-acts.^[Aliens required special permission to reside at Sparta, and the ephors had powers to expel them for undesirable conduct.] A result of this is that with the Cretans the serf population stands firm, whereas the Helots often revolt; for the Cretanstake no part in foreign empire, and also the island has only lately been invaded by warfare from abroad, rendering manifest the weakness of the legal system there.Let this suffice for our discussion of this form of constitution.Carthage also appears to have a good constitution, with many outstanding features as compared with those of other nations, but most nearly resembling the Spartan in some points. For these three constitutions are in a way near to one another and are widely different from the others—the Cretan, the Spartan and, thirdly, that of Carthage. Many regulations at Carthage are good; and a proof of a well-regulated constitution is that the populace willingly remain faithful to the constitutional system, and that neither civil strife has arisen in any degree worth mentioning, nor yet a tyrant.Points in which the Carthaginian constitution resembles the Spartan are the common mess-tables of its Comradeships corresponding to the Phiditia, and the magistracy of the Hundred and Four corresponding to the Ephors (except one point of superiority—the Ephors are drawn from any class, but the Carthaginians elect this magistracy by merit); the kings and the council of Elders correspond to the kings and Elders at Sparta, and it is another superior feature that the Carthaginian kings are not confined to the same family and that one of no particular distinction, and also that if any family distinguishes itself . . .^[Clauses seem to have been lost concluding the account of the appointment of the Kings and turning to the Elders and their selection on grounds of wealth.] the Elders are to be chosen from these rather than by age; for as they are put in control of important matters, if they are men of no value they do great harm,[^b459e84f4ea8427baaece5d0bc51dc5e]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Sabratha from Divus Vespasianus



Meanwhile, he married Flavia Domitilla, who had formerly been the mistress of Statilius Capella, a Roman knight of Sabrata in Africa, who [Domitilla] enjoyed Latin rights; and was soon after declared fully and freely a citizen of Rome, on a trial before the court of Recovery, brought by her father Flavius Liberalis, a native of Ferentum, but no more than secretary to a quaestor. By her he had the following children: Titus, Domitia nd Domitilla. He outlived his wife and daughter, and lost them both before he became emperor. After the death of his wife he renewed his union^[_"Revocavit in contubernium."_ From the difference of our habits, there is no word in the English language which exactly conveys the meaning of contubernium; a word which, in a military sense, the Romans applied to the intimate fellowship between comrades in war who messed together, and lived in close fellowship in the same tent. Thence they transferred it to a union with one woman who was in a higher position than a concubine, but, for some reason, could not acquire the legal rights of a wife, as in the case of slaves of either sex. A man of rank, also, could not marry a slave or a freedwoman, however much he might be attached to her.] with his former concubine, Caenis, the freedwoman of Antonia, and also her amanuensis, and treated her, even after he was emperor, almost as if she had been his lawful wife.^[Nearly the same phrases. are applied by Suetonius to Drusilla, see CALIGULA, c. xxiv., and to Marcella, the concubine of Commodus, by Herodian, 1. xvi. 9 , where he says that she had all the honours of an empress, except that the incense was not offered to her. These connections resembled the left-hand marriages of the German princes.][^7f9feba9418c4583ba38f74cdec98e60]

Virgil departed from Sabratha, intending to travel by ship, down the coast to Oea, a 47.362140362 mile journey. 

### A story by Apollodorus about Oea from Epitome



Ulysses, as some say, wandered about Libya, or, as some say, about Sicily, or, as others say, about the ocean or about the Tyrrhenian Sea.

And putting to sea from Ilium, he touched at Ismarus, a city of the Cicones, and captured it in war, and pillaged it, sparing Maro alone, who was priest of Apollo.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses with the Cicones, see Hom. Od. 9.39-66. The Cicones were a Thracian tribe; Xerxes and his army marched through their country (Hdt. 7.110). As to Maro, the priest of Apollo at Ismarus, see Hom. Od. 9.196-211. He dwelt in a wooded grove of Apollo, and bestowed splendid presents and twelve jars of red honey-sweet wine, in return for the protection which he and his wife received at the hands of Ulysses.] And when the Cicones who inhabited the mainland heard of it, they came in arms to withstand him, and having lost six men from each ship he put to sea and fled. And he landed in the country of the Lotus-eaters,^[As to the adventures of Ulysses with the Lotus-eaters, see Hom. Od. 9.82-104; Hyginus, Fab. 125. The Lotus-eaters were a tribe of northern Africa, inhabiting the coast of Tripolis (Scylax, Periplus 110; Pliny, Nat. Hist. v.28). As to the lotus, see Hdt. 4.177; Polybius xii.2.1, quoted by Athenaeus xiv.65, p. 651 DF; Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. iv.3.1ff. The tree is the Zizyphus Lotus of the botanists. Theophrastus says that the tree was common in Libya, that is, in northern Africa, and that an army marching on Carthage subsisted on its fruit alone for several days. The modern name of the tree is ssodr or ssidr. A whole district in Tripolis is named Ssodria after it. See A. Wiedemann, Herodots Zweites Buch, p. 385, note on Herodotus, ii.96.] and sent some to learn who inhabited it, but they tasted of the lotus and remained there; for there grew in the country a sweet fruit called lotus, which caused him who tasted it to forget everything. When Ulysses was informed of this, he restrained the rest of his men, and dragged those who had tasted the lotus by force to the ships. And having sailed to the land of the Cyclopes, he stood in for the shore.

And having left the rest of the ships in the neighboring island, he stood in for the land of the Cyclopes with a single ship, and landed with twelve companions.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses and his companions among the Cyclopes, see Hom. Od. 9.105-542; Hyginus, Fab. 125. The story is a folk-tale found in many lands. See Frazer's Appendix to Apollodorus, "Ulysses and Polyphemus."] And near the sea was a cave which he entered, taking with him the skin of wine that had been given him by Maro. Now the cave belonged to Polyphemus, who was a son of Poseidon and the nymph Thoosa, a huge, wild, cannibal man, with one eye on his forehead. And having lit a fire and sacrificed some of the kids, they feasted. But the Cyclops came, and when he had driven in his flocks, he put a huge stone to the door, and perceiving the men he ate some of them. But Ulysses gave him of Maro's wine to drink, and when he had drunk, he asked for another draught, and when he had drunk the second, he inquired his name; and when Ulysses said that he was called Nobody, he threatened to devour Nobody last and the others first, and that was the token of friendship which he promised to give him in return. And being overcome by wine, he fell asleep. But Ulysses found a club lying there, and with the help of four comrades he sharpened it, and, having heated it in the fire, he blinded him. And when Polyphemus cried to the Cyclopes round about for help, they came and asked who was hurting him, and when he said, " Nobody," they thought he meant that he was being hurt by nobody, and so they retired. And when the flocks sought their usual pasture, he opened the cave, and standing at the doorway spread out his hands and felt the sheep. But Ulysses tied three rams together,and himself getting under the bigger, and hiding under its belly, he passed out with the sheep. And having released his comrades from the sheep, he drove the animals to the ships, and sailing away shouted to the Cyclops that he was Ulysses and that he had escaped out of his hands. Now the Cyclops had been forewarned by a soothsayer that he should be blinded by Ulysses; and when he learned the name, he tore away rocks and hurled them into the sea, and hardly did the ship evade the rocks. From that time Poseidon was wroth with Ulysses.

Having put to sea with all his ships, he came to the island of Aeolia, of which the king was Aeolus.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses with Aeolus, the Keeper of the Winds, see Hom. Od. 10.1-76; Hyginus, Fab. 125; Ov. Met. 14.223-232.] He was appointed by Zeus keeper of the winds, both to calm them and to send them forth. Having entertained Ulysses, he gave him an oxhide bag in which he had bound fast the winds, after showing what winds to use on the voyage and binding fast the bag in the vessel. And by using suitable winds Ulysses had a prosperous voyage; and when he was near Ithaca and already saw the smoke rising from the town,^[Homer says (Hom. Od. 10.30) they were so near land that they could already see the men tending the fires (\rendergreek{πυρπολέοντας}); but whether the fires were signals to guide the ship to port, or watchfires of shepherds tending their flocks on the hills, does not appear.] he fell asleep. But his comrades, thinking he carried gold in the bag, loosed it and let the winds go free, and being swept away by the blasts they were driven back again. And having come to Aeolus, Ulysses begged that he might be granted a fair wind; but Aeolus drove him from the island, saying that he could not save him when the gods opposed.

So sailing on he came to the land of the Laestrygones,^[As to the adventures of Ulysses and his comrades among the Laestrygones, see Hom. Od. 10.80-132; Hyginus, Fab. 125; Ov. Met. 14.233-244.] andhis own ship he moored last. Now the Laestrygones were cannibals, and their king was Antiphates. Wishing, therefore, to learn about the inhabitants, Ulysses sent some men to inquire. But the king's daughter met them and led them to her father. And he snatched up one of them and devoured him; but the rest fled, and he pursued them, shouting and calling together the rest of the Laestrygones. They came to the sea, and by throwing stones they broke the vessels and ate the men. Ulysses cut the cable of his ship and put to sea; but the rest of the ships perished with their crews.

With one ship he put in to the Aeaean isle. It was inhabited by Circe, a daughter of the Sun and of Perse, and a sister of Aeetes; skilled in all enchantments was she.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses and his comrades with the enchantress Circe, see Hom. Od. 10.133-574; Hyginus, Fab. 125; Ov. Met. 14.246-440. The word (\rendergreek{φάρμακα}) here translated "enchantments" means primarily drugs; but in the early stages of medicine drugs were supposed to be endowed with magical potency, partly in virtue of the spells, that is, the form of words, with which the medical practitioner administered them to the patient. Hence druggist and enchanter were nearly synonymous terms. As Circe used her knowledge of drugs purely for magical purposes, without any regard to the medical side of the profession, it seems better to translate her \rendergreek{φάρμακα} by "enchantments" or "charms" rather than "drugs," and to call her an enchantress instead of a druggist.] Having divided his comrades, Ulysses himself abode by the ship, in accordance with the lot, but Eurylochus with two and twenty comrades repaired to Circe. At her call they all entered except Eurylochus; and to each she gave a tankard she had filled with cheese and honey and barley meal and wine, and mixed with an enchantment. And when they had drunk, she touched them with a wand and changed their shapes, and some she made wolves, and some swine, and some asses, and some lions.^[In Hom. Od. 10.237ff.) the companions of Ulysses are turned into swine only; nothing is said about a transformation of them into wolves, lions, and asses, though round about the house of the enchantress they saw wolves and lions, which stood on their hind legs, wagged their tails, and fawned upon them, because they were men enchanted (Hom. Od. 10.210-219).] But Eurylochus saw these things and reported them to Ulysses. And Ulysses went to Circe with moly,^[As to moly, see Hom. Od. 10.302-306. Homer says that it was a plant dug up from the earth, with a black root and a white flower. According to Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. ix.15.7, moly resembled _Allium nigrum_, which was found in the valley of Pheneus and on Mount Cyllene in northern Arcadia; he says it had a round root, like an onion, and a leaf like a squill, and that it was used as an antidote to spells and enchantments. But probably the moly of Homer grew on no earthly hill or valley, but only in "fairyland forlorn."] which he had received from Hermes, and throwing the moly among her enchantments, he drank and alone was not enchanted. Then drawing his sword, he would have killed her, but she appeased his wrath and restored his comrades. And when he had taken an oath of her that he should suffer no harm, Ulysses shared her bed, and a son, Telegonus, was born to him.^[Telegonus is unknown to Homer, who mentions no offspring of Ulysses by the enchantress Circe. He is named as a son of Ulysses and Circe by Hesiod in a line which is suspected, however, of being spurious (Hes. Th. 1014). He was recognized by Hagias in his epic, The Returns, and by another Cyclic poet Eugammon of Cyrene; indeed Eugammon composed an epic called the Telegony on the adventures of Telegonus, but according to him Telegonus was a son of Ulysses by Calypso, not by Circe. See Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta, ed. G. Kinkel, pp. 56, 57ff.; Eustathius on Hom. Od. xvi.118, p. 1796. According to Hyginus, Fab. 125, Ulysses had two sons, Nausithous and Telegonus, by Circe. As to Telegonus, see also below, Apollod. E.7.36ff.] Having tarried a year there, he sailed the ocean, and offered sacrifices to the souls,^[The visit of Ulysses to the land of the dead is the theme of the eleventh book of the Odyssey. Compare Hyginus, Fab. 125. The visit was the subject of one of the two great pictures by Polygnotus at Delphi. See Paus. 10.28-31.] and by Circe's advice consulted the soothsayer Tiresias,^[As to the consultation with Tiresias, see Hom. Od. 11.90-151.] and beheld the souls both of heroes and of heroines. He also looked on his mother Anticlia^[As to the interview of Ulysses with his mother, see Hom. Od. 11.153-224.] and Elpenor, who had died of a fall in the house of Circe.^[In the hot air of Circe's enchanted isle Elpenor had slept for coolness on the roof of the palace; then, suddenly wakened by the noise and bustle of his comrades making ready to depart, he started up and, forgetting to descend by the ladder, tumbled from the roof and broke his neck. In his hurry to be off, Ulysses had not stayed to bury his dead comrade; so the soul of Elpenor, unwept and unburied, was the first to meet his captain on the threshold of the spirit land. See Hom. Od. 10.552-560; Hom. Od. 11.51-83.]

And having come to Circe he was sent on his way by her, and put to sea, and sailed past the isle of the Sirens.^[As to the return of Ulysses to the isle of Circe, and his sailing past the Sirens, see Hom. Od. 12.1-200; Hyginus, Fab. 125. Homer does not name the Sirens individually nor mention their parentage, but by using the dual in reference to them (Hom. Od. 12.52; Hom. Od. 12.167) he indicates that they were two in number. Sophocles, in his play Ulysses, called the Sirens daughters of Phorcus, and agreed with Homer in recognizing only two of them. See Plut. Quaest. Conviv. ix.14.6; The Fragments of Sophocles, ed. A. C. Pearson, iii.66, frag. 861. Apollonius Rhodius says that the Muse Terpsichore bore the Sirens to Achelous (Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.895ff.). Hyginus names four of them, Teles, Raidne, Molpe, and Thelxiope (Hyginus, Fab. praefat. p. 30, ed. Bunte), and, in agreement with Apollodorus, says that they were the offspring of Achelous by the Muse Melpomene. Tzetzes calls them Parthenope, Leucosia, and Ligia, but adds that other people named them Pisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepia, and that they were the children of Achelous and Terpsichore. With regard to the parts which they took in the bewitching concert, he agrees with Apollodorus. See Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 712. According to a Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon.iv.892, their names were Thelxiope, or Thelxione, Molpe, and Aglaophonus. As to their names and parents see also Eustathius on Hom. Od. 12. p. 1709, Scholiast on Hom. Od. xii.39, who mention the view that the father of the Sirens was Achelous, and that their mother was either the Muse Terpsichore, or Sterope, daughter of Porthaon.] Now the Sirens were Pisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepia, daughters of Achelous and Melpomene, one of the Muses. One of them played the lyre, another sang, and another played the flute, and by these means they were fain to persuade passing mariners to linger; and from the thighs they had the forms of birds.^[Similarly Apollonius Rhodius (Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.898ff.) describes the Sirens as partly virgins and partly birds. Aelian tells us (Ael., Nat. Anim. xvii.23) that poets and painters represented them as winged maidens with the feet of birds. Ovid says that the Sirens had the feet and feathers of birds, but the faces of virgins; and he asks why these daughters of Achelous, as he calls them, had this hybrid form. Perhaps, he thinks, it was because they had been playing with Persephone when gloomy Dis carried her off, and they had begged the gods to grant them wings, that they might search for their lost playmate over seas as well as land. See Ov. Met. 5.552-562. In like manner Hyginus describes the Sirens as women above and fowls below, but he says that their wings and feathers were a punishment inflicted on them by Demeter for not rescuing Persephone from the clutches of Pluto. See Hyginus, Fab. 125, 141. Another story was that they were maidens whom Aphrodite turned into birds because they chose to remain unmarried. See Eustathius on Hom. Od. 12.47, p. 1709. It is said that they once vied with the Muses in singing, and that the Muses, being victorious, plucked off the Siren's feathers and made crowns out of them for themselves (Paus. 9.34.3). In ancient art, as in literature, the Sirens are commonly represented as women above and birds below. See Miss J. E. Harrison, Myths of the Odyssey (London, 1882), pp. 146ff. Homer says nothing as to the semi-bird shape of the Sirens, thus leaving us to infer that they were purely human.] Sailing by them, Ulysses wished to hear their song, so by Circe's advice he stopped the ears of his comrades with wax, and ordered that he should himself be bound to the mast. And being persuaded by the Sirens to linger, he begged to be released, but they bound him the more, and so he sailed past. Now it was predicted of the Sirens that they should themselves die when a ship should pass them; so die they did.^[This is not mentioned by Homer, but is affirmed by Hyginus, Fab. 125, 141). Others said that the Sirens cast themselves into the sea and were drowned from sheer vexation at the escape of Ulysses. See Scholiast on Hom. Od.xii.39; Eustathius on Hom. Od. 12.167, p. 1709; Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 712; compare Strab. 6.1.1.]

And after that he came to two ways. On the one side were the Wandering Rocks,^[As to Ulysses and the Wandering Rocks, see Hom. Od. 12.52-72; Hom. Od. 12.201-221. The poet mentions (Hom. Od. 12.70-72) the former passage of the Argo between the Wandering or Clashing Rocks, as to which see above Apollod. 1.9.22, with the note. It has been suggested that in the story of the Wandering Rocks we have a confused reminiscence of some sailor's story of floating icebergs. See Merry, on Homer, Od. xii.61.] and on the other side two huge cliffs, and in one of them was Scylla,^[As to the passage of Ulysses between Scylla and Charybdis, see Hom. Od. 12.73-126; Hom. Od. 12.222-259; Hyginus, Fab. 125, 199.] a daughter of Crataeis and Trienus or Phorcus,^[Homer mentions Crataeis as the mother of Scylla, but says nothing as to her father (Hom. Od. 12.124ff.). According to Stesichorus, the mother of Scylla was Lamia. See Scholiast on Hom. Od. 12.124; Eustathius on Hom. Od. xii.85, p. 1714. Apollonius Rhodius represents Scylla as a daughter of Phorcus by the night-wandering hag Hecate (Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.828ff.), and this parentage has the support of Acusilaus, except that he named her father Phorcys instead of Phorcus (Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.828; compare Eustathius on Hom. Od. xii.85, p. 1714). Hyginus calls her a daughter of Typhon and Echidna (Hyginus, Fab. 125, 151, and praefat. p. 31, ed. Bunte). A Scholiast on Plat. Rep. 9, 588c, who may have copied the present passage of Apollodorus, calls Scylla a daughter of Crataeis and Tyrrhenus or Phorcus, adding that she had the face and breasts of a woman, but from the flanks six heads of dogs and twelve feet. Some said that the father of Scylla was Triton (Eustathius on Hom. Od. xii.85, p. 1714); and perhaps the name Triton should be read instead of Trienus in the present passage of Apollodorus. See the Critical Note.] with the face and breast of a woman, but from the flanks she had six heads and twelve feet of dogs. And in the other cliff was Charybdis, who thrice a day drew up the water and spouted it again. By the advice of Circe he shunned the passage by the Wandering Rocks, and in sailing past the cliff of Scylla he stood fully armed on the poop. But Scylla appeared, snatched six of his comrades, and gobbled them up. And thence he came to Thrinacia, an island of the Sun, where kine were grazing, and being windbound, he tarried there.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses in Thrinacia, the island of the Sun, see Hom. Od. 12.127-141; Hom. Od. 12.260-402.] But when his comrades slaughtered some of the kine and banqueted on them, for lack of food, the Sun reported it to Zeus, and when Ulysses put out to sea, Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt.^[See Hom. Od. 12.403-425.] And when the ship broke up, Ulysses clung to the mast and drifted to Charybdis. And when Charybdis sucked down the mast, he clutched an overhanging wild fig-tree and waited, and when he saw the mast shot up again, he cast himself on it, and was carried across to the island of Ogygia.^[See Hom. Od. 12.426-450, compare Hom. Od. 5.128-135.]

There Calypso, daughter of Atlas, received him, and bedding with him bore a son Latinus. He stayed with her five years, and then made a raft and sailed away.^[As to the stay of Ulysses with Calypso in the island of Ogygia, and his departure in a boat of his own building, see Hom. Od. 5.13-281; Hom. Od. 7.243-266; Hyginus, Fab. 125. According to Hom. Od. 7.259, Ulysses stayed seven years with Calypso, not five years, as Apollodorus says. Hyginus limits the stay to one year. Homer does not mention that Calypso bore a son to Ulysses. In the Theogony of Hesiod (Hes. Th. 1111ff.) it is said that Circe (not Calypso), bore two sons, Agrius and Latinus, to Ulysses; the verses, however, are probably not by Hesiod but have been interpolated by a later poet of the Roman era in order to provide the Latins with a distinguished Greek ancestry. The verses are quoted by the Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon. iii.200. Compare Joannes Lydus, De mensibus i.13, p. 7, ed. Bekker. Eustathius says (Eustathius on Hom. Od. xvi.118, p. 1796) that, according to Hesiod, Ulysses had two sons, Agrius and Latinus, by Circe, and two sons, Nausithous and Nausinous, by Calypso.] But on the high sea the raft was broken in pieces by the wrath of Poseidon, and Ulysses was washed up naked on the shore of the Phaeacians.^[See Hom. Od. 5.282-493; Hyginus, Fab. 125.] Now Nausicaa, the daughter of king Alcinous, was washing the clothes, and when Ulysses implored her protection, she brought him to Alcinous, who entertained him, and after bestowing gifts on him sent him away with a convoy to his native land.^[See Hom. Od. 6; Hom. Od. 7; Hom. Od. 8; Hom. Od. 12.1-124; Hyginus, Fab. 125.] But Poseidon was wroth with the Phaeacians, and he turned the ship to stone and enveloped the city with a mountain.^[See Hom. Od. 12.125-187. "Poseidon does not propose to bury the city, but to shut it off from the use of its two harbours (cp. Hom. Od. 6.263) by some great mountain mass" (Merry on Hom. Od. 12.152).]

And on arriving in his native land Ulysses found his substance wasted; for, believing that he was dead, suitors were wooing Penelope.^[The number of the suitors, according to Homer, was one hundred and eight, namely, fifty-two from Dulichium, twenty-four from Same, twenty from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca. See Hom. Od. 16.245-253. Apollodorus gives the numbers from these islands as fifty-seven, twenty-three, forty-four, and twelve respectively, or a hundred and thirty-six in all. Homer does not give a regular list of the names, but mentions some of them incidentally.] From Dulichium came fifty-seven: Amphinomus, Thoas, Demoptolemus, Amphimachus, Euryalus, Paralus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Eurypylus, Pylaemenes, Acamas, Thersilochus, Hagius, Clymenus, Philodemus, Meneptolemus, Damastor, Bias, Telmius, Polyidus, Astylochus, Schedius, Antigonus, Marpsius, Iphidamas, Argius, Glaucus, Calydoneus, Echion, Lamas, Andraemon, Agerochus, Medon, Agrius, Promus, Ctesius, Acarnan, Cycnus, Pseras, Hellanicus, Periphron, Megasthenes, Thrasymedes, Ormenius, Diopithes, Mecisteus, Antimachus, Ptolemaeus, Lestorides, Nicomachus, Polypoetes, and Ceraus. And from Samethere came twenty—three:— Agelaus, Pisander, Elatus, Ctesippus, Hippodochus, Eurystratus, Archemolus, Ithacus, Pisenor, Hyperenor, Pheroetes, Antisthenes, Cerberus, Perimedes, Cynnus, Thriasus, Eteoneus, Clytius, Prothous, Lycaethus, Eumelus, Itanus, Lyammus. And from Zacynthos came forty—four: Eurylochus, Laomedes, Molebus, Phrenius, Indius, Minis, Liocritus, Pronomus, Nisas, Daemon, Archestratus, Hippomachus, Euryalus, Periallus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Polybus, Polydorus, Thadytius, Stratius, Phrenius, Indius, Daesenor, Laomedon, Laodicus, Halius, Magnes, Oloetrochus, Barthas, Theophron, Nissaeus, Alcarops, Periclymenus, Antenor, Pellas, Celtus, Periphus, Ormenus, Polybus and Andromedes. And from Ithaca itself the suitors were twelve, to wit:— Antinous, Pronous, Liodes, Eurynomus, Amphimachus, Amphialus, Promachus, Amphimedon, Aristratus, Helenus, Dulicheus, and Ctesippus.

These, journeying to the palace, consumed the herds of Ulysses at their feasts.^[As to the reckless waste of the suitors, see Hom. Od. 14.80-109.] And Penelope was compelled to promise that she would wed when the shroud of Laertes was finished, and she wove it for three years, weaving it by day and undoing it by night. In this way the suitors were deceived by Penelope, till she was detected.^[As to Penelope's web, see Hom. Od. 19.136-158; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] And Ulysses, being apprized of the state of things at home, came to his servant Eumaeus in the guise of a beggar,^[As to the meeting of Ulysses and Eumaeus, see Hom. Od. 14.1-492; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] and made himself known to Telemachus,^[As to the meeting and recognition of Ulysses and Telemachus, see Hom. Od. 16.1-234.] and arrived in the city. And Melanthius, the goatherd, a servant man, met them, and scorned them.^[See Hom. Od. 17.184-253.] On coming to the palace Ulysses begged food of the suitors,^[See Hom. Od. 17.360-457.] and finding a beggar called Irus he wrestled with him.^[See Hom. Od. 18.1-107; Hyginus, Fab. 126. In Homer it is in a boxing-match, not in a wrestling-bout, that Ulysses vanquishes the braggart beggar Irus. Hyginus, like Apollodorus, substitutes wrestling for boxing.] But he revealed himself to Eumaeus and Philoetius, and along with them and Telemachus he laid a plot for the suitors.^[See Hom. Od. 21.188-244.] Now Penelope delivered to the suitors the bow of Ulysses, which he had once received from Iphitus; and she said that she would marry him who bent the bow.^[See Hom. Od. 21.1-82; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] When none of them could bend it, Ulysses took it and shot down the suitors, with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.^[See Hom. Od. 21.140-434, Hom. Od. 22.1-389; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] He killed also Melanthius, and the handmaids that bedded with the suitors,^[See Hom. Od. 22.417-477.] and he made himself known to his wife and his father.^[See Hom. Od. 22.153-297; Hom. Od. 24.205-348.]

And after sacrificing to Hades, and Persephone, and Tiresias, he journeyed on foot through Epirus, and came to the Thesprotians, and having offered sacrifice according to the directions of the soothsayer Tiresias, he propitiated Poseidon.^[Tiresias had warned Ulysses that, after slaying the suitors, he must journey inland till he came to a country where men knew not the sea, and where a wayfarer would mistake for a winnowing-fan the oar which Ulysses was carrying on his shoulder. There Ulysses was to sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Poseidon, the god whom he had offended. See Hom. Od. 11.119-131. But the journey itself and the sacrifice are not recorded by Homer. In a little island off Cos a Greek skipper told Dr. W. H. D. Rouse a similar story about the journey inland of the prophet Elias. The prophet, according to this account, was a fisherman who, long buffeted by storms, conceived a horror of the sea, and, putting an oar on his shoulder, took to the hills and walked till he met a man who did not know what an oar was. There the prophet planted his oar in the ground, and there he resolved to abide. That is why all the prophet's chapels are on the tops of hills. This legend was published by Dr. Rouse in The Cambridge Review under the heading of "A Greek skipper." This and the remaining part of Apollodorus are probably drawn from the epic poem Telegony, a work by Eugammon of Cyrene, of which a short abstract by Proclus has been preserved. See Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta, ed. G. Kinkel, pp. 57ff. The author of the abstract informs us that after the death and burial of the suitors "Ulysses sacrificed to the nymphs and sailed to Elis to inspect the herds. And he was entertained by Polyxenus and received a present of a bowl. And after that followed the episodes of Trophonius, and Agamedes, and Augeas. Then he sailed home to Ithaca and offered the sacrifices prescribed by Tiresias. And after these things he went to the Thesprotians and married Callidice, queen of the Thesprotians. Then the Thesprotians made war on the Brygians, under the leadership of Ulysses. There Ares put Ulysses and his people to flight, and Athena engaged him in battle; but Apollo reconciled them. And after Callidice's death, Polypoetes, son of Ulysses, succeeded to the kingdom, and Ulysses himself went to Ithaca. Meanwhile Telegonus, sailing in search of his father, landed in Ithaca and ravaged the island; and marching out to repel him Ulysses was killed by his son in ignorance. Recognizing his error, Telegonus transported his father's body, and Telemachus, and Penelope to his mother, and she made them immortal. And Telegonus married Penelope, and Telemachus married Circe." The tradition, mentioned also by Hyginus, Fab. 127, that one son of Ulysses (Telegonus) married his father's widow (Penelope), and that another son (Telemachus) married his father's concubine (Circe), is very remarkable, and may possibly point to an old custom according to which a son inherited his father's wives and concubines, with the exception of his own mother. Compare Apollod. 2.7.7, with Frazer's note (vol. i. p. 269). Apollodorus mentions the marriage of Telegonus to Penelope (see below), but not the marriage of Telemachus to Circe.] But Callidice, who was then queen of the Thesprotians, urged him to stay and offered him the kingdom; and she had by him a son Polypoetes. And having married Callidice, he reigned over the Thesprotians, and defeated in battle the neighboring peoples who attacked him. But when Callidice died he handed over the kingdom to his son and repaired to Ithaca, and there he found Poliporthes, whom Penelope had borne to him.^[Compare Paus. 8.12.6, from whom we learn that the birth of this son Poliporthes or Ptoliporthes, as Pausanias calls him, was mentioned in the epic poem Thesprotis.] When Telegonus learned from Circe that he was a son of Ulysses, he sailed in search of him. And having come to the island of Ithaca, he drove away some of the cattle, and when Ulysses defended them, Telegonus wounded him with the spear he had in his hands, which was barbed with the spine of a sting-ray, and Ulysses died of the wound.^[Compare Oppian, Halieut. ii.497-500; Scholia Graeca in Homeri Odysseam, ed. G. Dindorf, vol. i. p. 6; Hom. Od. 11.134; Eustathius on Hom. Od. xi.133, p. 1676; Philostratus, Vit. Apollon. vi.32; Philostratus, Her. iii.42; Parthenius, Narrat. 3; Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 794; Scholiast on Aristoph. Plutus 303; Cicero, Tusc. Disp. ii.21.48ff.; Hor. Carm. 3.29.8; Hyginus, Fab. 127; Ovid, Ibis 567ff.; Dictys Cretensis vi.14ff.; Serv. Verg. A. 2.44. The fish (\rendergreek{τρυγών}), whose spine is said to have barbed the fatal spear, is the common stingray (_Trygon pastinaca_), as I learn from Professor D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, who informs me that the fish is abundant in the Mediterranean and not uncommon on our southern coasts. For ancient descriptions of the fish he refers me to Oppian, Halieut. ii.470ff. (the _locus classicus_); Ael., Nat. Anim. i.56; Nicander, Ther. 828ff. According to Aelian, the wound inflicted by the stingray is incurable. Hercules is said to have lost one of his fingers by the bite of a stingray (Ptolemy Hephaest., Nov. Hist. ii. in Westermann's Mythographi Graeci, p. 184). Classical scholars, following Liddell and Scott, sometimes erroneously identify the fish with the roach. The death of Ulysses through the wound of a stingray is foreshadowed in the prophecy of Tiresias that his death would come from the sea (Hom. Od. 11.134ff.). According to a Scholiast on Hom. (Scholia Graeca in Homeri Odysseam, ed. G. Dindorf, vol. i. p. 6), Hyginus, and Dictys Cretensis, Ulysses had been warned by an oracle or a dream to beware of his son, who would kill him; accordingly, fearing to be slain by Telemachus, he banished him to Cephallenia (Dictys Cretensis vi.14). But he forgot his son Telegonus, whom he had left behind with his mother Circe in her enchanted island. The death of Ulysses at the hands of his son Telegonus was the subject of a tragedy by Sophocles. See The Fragments of Sophocles, ed. A. C. Pearson, vol. ii. pp. 105ff.] But when Telegonus recognized him, he bitterly lamented, and conveyed the corpse and Penelope to Circe, and there he married Penelope. And Circe sent them both away to the Islands of the Blest.

But some say that Penelope was seduced by Antinous and sent away by Ulysses to her father Icarius, and that when she came to Mantinea in Arcadia she bore Pan to Hermes.^[A high mound of earth was shown as the grave of Penelope at Mantinea in Arcadia. According to the Mantinean story, Ulysses had found her unfaithful and banished her the house; so she went first to her native Sparta, and afterwards to Mantinea, where she died and was buried. See Paus. 8.12.5ff. The tradition that Penelope was the mother of Pan by Hermes (Mercury) is mentioned by Cicero, De natura deorum iii.22.56. According to Duris, the Samian, Penelope was the mother of Pan by all the suitors (Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 772). The same story is mentioned also by Serv. Verg. A. 2.44, who says that Penelope was supposed to have given birth to Pan during her husband's absence, and that when Ulysses came home and found the monstrous infant in the house, he fled and set out afresh on his wanderings.] However others say that she met her end at the hands of Ulysses himself on account of Amphinomus,^[Amphinomus was one of the suitors of Penelope; his words pleased her more than those of the other suitors, because he had a good understanding. See Hom. Od. 16.394-398. He was afterwards killed by Telemachus (Hom. Od. 12. 89ff.). The suspicion that Penelope was unfaithful to her husband has no support in Homer.] for they allege that she was seduced by him. And there are some who say that Ulysses, being accused by the kinsfolk of the slain, submitted the case to the judgment of Neoptolemus, king of the islands off Epirus; that Neoptolemus, thinking to get possession of Cephallenia if once Ulysses were put out of the way, condemned him to exile;^[Compare Plut. Quaest. Graec. 14. According to Plutarch's account, the kinsmen of the slain suitors rose in revolt against Ulysses; but Neoptolemus, being invited by both parties to act as arbitrator, sentenced Ulysses to banishment for bloodshed, and condemned the friends and relatives of the suitors to pay an annual compensation to Ulysses for the damage they had done to his property. The sentence obliged Ulysses to withdraw not only from Ithaca, but also from Cephallenia and Zacynthus; and he retired to Italy. The compensation exacted from the heirs of the suitors was paid in kind, and consisted of barley groats, wine, honey, olive oil, and animal victims of mature age. This payment Ulysses ordered to be made to his son Telemachus.] and that Ulysses went to Aetolia, to Thoas, son of Andraemon, married the daughter of Thoas, and leaving a son Leontophonus, whom he had by her,^[These last recorded doings of Ulysses appear to be mentioned by no other ancient writer.] died in old age.[^fd2ba81dd1354d85adafd228f9dc6d96]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Sabratha from Divus Vespasianus



Meanwhile, he married Flavia Domitilla, who had formerly been the mistress of Statilius Capella, a Roman knight of Sabrata in Africa, who [Domitilla] enjoyed Latin rights; and was soon after declared fully and freely a citizen of Rome, on a trial before the court of Recovery, brought by her father Flavius Liberalis, a native of Ferentum, but no more than secretary to a quaestor. By her he had the following children: Titus, Domitia nd Domitilla. He outlived his wife and daughter, and lost them both before he became emperor. After the death of his wife he renewed his union^[_"Revocavit in contubernium."_ From the difference of our habits, there is no word in the English language which exactly conveys the meaning of contubernium; a word which, in a military sense, the Romans applied to the intimate fellowship between comrades in war who messed together, and lived in close fellowship in the same tent. Thence they transferred it to a union with one woman who was in a higher position than a concubine, but, for some reason, could not acquire the legal rights of a wife, as in the case of slaves of either sex. A man of rank, also, could not marry a slave or a freedwoman, however much he might be attached to her.] with his former concubine, Caenis, the freedwoman of Antonia, and also her amanuensis, and treated her, even after he was emperor, almost as if she had been his lawful wife.^[Nearly the same phrases. are applied by Suetonius to Drusilla, see CALIGULA, c. xxiv., and to Marcella, the concubine of Commodus, by Herodian, 1. xvi. 9 , where he says that she had all the honours of an empress, except that the incense was not offered to her. These connections resembled the left-hand marriages of the German princes.][^7d40aa01262f4400a328d8529e3ef490]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Oea from Historiae



But when the agitation of the people, the execution of the centurion, and other news, true or false, exaggerated as usual by report, came to the ears of Festus, he sent some cavalry to put Piso to death. They rode over at full speed, and broke into the dwelling of the proconsul in the dim light of early dawn, with their swords drawn in their hands. Many of them were unacquainted with the person of Piso, for the legate had selected some Moorish and Carthaginian auxiliaries to perpetrate the deed. Near the proconsul's chamber they chanced to meet a slave, and asked him who he was, and where Piso was to be found? The slave with a noble untruth replied, "I am he," and was immediately cut down. Soon after Piso was killed, for there was on the spot one who recognized him, Bæbius Massa, one of the procurators of Africa, a name even then fatal to the good, and destined often to reappear among the causes of the sufferings which he had ere long to endure. From Adrumetum, where he had stayed to watch the result, Festus went to the legion, and gave orders that Cetronius Pisanus, prefect of the camp, should be put in irons. He did this out of private pique, but he called the man an accomplice of Piso. Some few centurions and soldiers he punished, others he rewarded, neither the one nor the other deservedly, but he wished men to believe that he had extinguished a war. He then put an end to a quarrel between the Œenses and the Leptitani, which, originating in robberies of corn and cattle by two rustic populations, had grown from this insignificant beginning till it was carried on in pitched battles. The people of Œea, who were inferior in numbers, had summoned to their aid the Garamantes, a wild race incessantly occupied in robbing their neighbours. This had brought the Leptitani to extremities; their territories had been ravaged far and wide, and they were trembling within their walls, when the Garamantes were put to flight by the arrival of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry, and the whole of the booty was recaptured, with the exception of some which the plunderers, in their wanderings through inaccessible hamlets, had sold to more distant tribes.[^71772064f8d24ecbbb91d4453c4ff7f8]

### A story by Flavius Josephus about Cyrene from Life of Josephus



But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea, and conjectured that the lands which I had in Judea would bring me no profit, because a garrison to guard the country was afterward to pitch there, he gave me another country in the plain. And when he was going away to Rome, he made choice of me to sail along with him, and paid me great respect: and when we were come to Rome, I had great care taken of me by Vespasian; for he gave me an apartment in his own house, which he lived in before he came to the empire. He also honored me with the privilege of a Roman citizen, and gave me an annual pension; and continued to respect me to the end of his life, without any abatement of his kindness to me; which very thing made me envied, and brought me into danger; for a certain Jew, whose name was Jonathan, who had raised a tumult in Cyrene, and had persuaded two thousand men of that country to join with him, was the occasion of their ruin. But when he was bound by the governor of that country, and sent to the emperor, he told him that I had sent him both weapons and money. However, he could not conceal his being a liar from Vespasian, who condemned him to die; according to which sentence he was put to death. Nay, after that, when those that envied my good fortune did frequently bring accusations against me, by God's providence I escaped them all. I also received from Vespasian no small quantity of land, as a free gift, in Judea; about which time I divorced my wife also, as not pleased with her behavior, though not till she had been the mother of three children, two of whom are dead, and one whom I named Hyrcanus, is alive. After this I married a wife who had lived at Crete, but a Jewess by birth: a woman she was of eminent parents, and such as were the most illustrious in all the country, and whose character was beyond that of most other women, as her future life did demonstrate. By her I had two sons; the elder's name was Justus, and the next Simonides, who was also named Agrippa. And these were the circumstances of my domestic affairs. However, the kindness of the emperor to me continued still the same; for when Vespasian was dead, Titus, who succeeded him in the government, kept up the same respect for me which I had from his father; and when I had frequent accusations laid against me, he would not believe them. And Domitian, who succeeded, still augmented his respects to me; for he punished those Jews that were my accusers, and gave command that a servant of mine, who was a eunuch, and my accuser, should be punished. He also made that country I had in Judea tax free, which is a mark of the greatest honor to him who hath it; nay, Domitia, the wife of Caesar, continued to do me kindnesses. And this is the account of the actions of my whole life; and let others judge of my character by them as they please. But to thee, O Epaphroditus,^[Of this Epaphroditus, see the note on the Preface to the Antiquities.] thou most excellent of men! do I dedicate all this treatise of our Antiquities; and so, for the present, I here conclude the whole.[^2312610528c148998f7e52b08626e1fd]

### A story by Flavius Josephus about Ptolemais from Life of Josephus



Now king Agrippa sent an army to make themselves masters of the citadel of Gamala, and over it Equieulus Modius; but the forces that were sent were not allow to encompass the citadel quite round, but lay before it in the open places, and besieged it. But when Ebutius the decurion, who was intrusted with the government of the great plain, heard that I was at Simonias, a village situated in the confines of Galilee, and was distant from him sixty furlongs, he took a hundred horsemen that were with him by night, and a certain number of footmen, about two hundred, and brought the inhabitants of the city Gibea along with him as auxiliaries, and marched in the night, and came to the village where I abode. Upon this I pitched my camp over against him, which had a great number of forces in it: but Ebutius tried to draw us down into the plain, as greatly depending upon his horsemen; but we would not come down; for when I was satisfied of the advantage that his horse would have if we came down into the plain, while we were all footmen, I resolved to join battle with the enemy where I was. Now Ebutius and his party made a courageous opposition for some time; but when he saw that his horse were useless to him in that place, he retired back to the city Gibea, having lost three of his men in the fight. So I followed him directy with two thousand armed men; and when I was at the city Besara, that lay in the confines of Ptolemais, but twenty furlongs from Gibea, where Ebutius abode, I placed my armed men on the outside of the village, and gave orders that they should guard the passes with great care, that the enemy might not disturb us until we should have carried off the corn, a great quantity of which lay there: it belonged to Bernice the queen, and had been gathered together out of the neighboring villages into Besara; so I loaded my camels and asses, a great number of which I had brought along with me, and sent the corn into Galilee. When I had done this, I offered Ebutius battle; but when he would not accept of the offer, for he was terrified at our readiness and courage, I altered my route, and marched towards Neopolitanus, because I had heard that the country about Tiberias was laid waste by him. This Neopolitanus was captain of a troop of horse, and had the custody of Scythopolis intrusted to his care by the enemy; and when I had hindered him from doing any further mischief to Tiberias, I set myself to make provision for the affairs of Galilee.[^c7ddbfd78e64498fb0d336b8d34857d4]

### A story by Pindar about Cyrene from Pythian



Today you must stand beside a man dear to me,  
by the king of horsefamed Cyrene,  
and joining with Archesilaus in his victory revels,  
Muse, swell the breeze of songs  
owed to Leto's Twins and to Pytho,  
where once the priestess sitting in honor  
beside the golden eagles of Zeus,  
Apollo now in his land, proclaimed  
by oracle that Battos would be founder  
of fruitbearing Libya,  
so that he'd finally leave the holy  
island and plant  
a city of fine chariots  
on a chalky breast of earth,  
and redeem in the seventeenth generation  
the word of Medea  
which at Thera once Aeëtes' fierce daughter  
breathed from immortal lips,  
the Colchean queen.  
Thus she spoke to the demigods  
who sailed with spearman Jason:  
"Hear me, you sons  
of bold-hearted men and gods:  
I say that from this wave-beaten land  
the daughter of Epaphus will one day  
be planted with the root of other cities,  
cities renowned among men,  
amid the foundations of Zeus Ammon.  
"And, changing short-finned dolphins  
for swift horses,  
they shall ply reins rather than oars  
and drive chariots with stormfoot teams.  
That Omen shall make Thera  
metropolis of mighty cities, the Omen  
which once amid the stream from lake Triton,  
Euphemus, descending the prow,  
received from a god in human form  
who offered him  
a guest-gift of earth  
—for him father Zeus, son of Kronos,  
rang out a peal of auspicious thunder—:  
"at the time he met us hoisting against ship  
the bronze-fluked anchor,  
swift Argo's bridle;  
for twelve days before we'd been carrying  
the seagoing timber from Ocean  
over desolate stretches of land,  
having drawn her up at my advice.  
Then in that instant all alone  
the god approached us,  
assuming the glad countenance  
of a solicitous man;  
and he began with friendly words,  
those the charitable host first uses  
to offer newly-arrived strangers a meal.  
But the plea of our sweet homecoming  
checked us staying. He said he was  
Eurypylus, son of the immortal  
Holder and Shaker of earth;  
he knew our haste; swiftly  
scooping up a handful of soil  
with his right hand, he sought to give us  
a chance gift of hospitality;  
nor did he refuse it, the hero, but leapt to shore  
and, pressing hand with hand,  
accepted the divine clod.  
But I hear it was washed  
overboard one evening  
to wander seaward with the salt  
waves, following the sinuous waters  
of the deep. Often indeed I urged  
the attendants, who ease our labor,  
to guard it; but they forgot,  
and now the imperishable seed  
of spacious Libya  
is shed on this island before its time.  
For had he cast the seed down at home  
by Hade's earthfast mouth,  
after returning to sacred Tanaeus, Euphemus,  
horse-ruling Poseidon's lordly son,  
whom Europa, daughter of Tityos,  
once bore by the banks of Cephesus,  
his blood in the fourth generation after him  
would have seized that vast continent  
together with the Danaans;  
for then will they depart from great Sparta,  
from the gulf of Argos and from Mycenae.  
Now, however, in the beds of alien women  
he shall discover a chosen race  
who, by favor of the gods,  
will come to this island  
and beget a man to be  
lord over plains  
cloaked in cloudshadow;  
and one day Apollo, in his gold-filled house,  
will admonish him by oracle,  
when at length he enters the Pythian shrine,  
to lead a host of men in ships  
to the rich precinct of Zeus Ammon by the Nile."  
So spoke the ranks of Media's speech,  
and they crouched stockstill, in silence,  
the godlike heroes  
listening to her shrewd counsel.  
O fortunate son of Polymnestus,  
you it was whom, as this speech foretold,  
the oracle of the Delphic Bee  
exalted with her spontaneous shout,  
she who thrice crying "Hail"  
revealed you the predestined  
king of Cyrene,  
when you were asking what release might come  
from the gods for a stammering voice.  
After long time, even now, as at the peak  
of crimson-flowered spring,  
eighth in line from these children blossoms  
Archesilaus: to whom Apollo and Pytho  
granted glory in the chariot race  
from the hands of the Amphictyons.  
I shall offer to the Muses  
him and the golden fleece of the ram:  
for when the Minyans sailed after it,  
heaven-sent honors  
were planted for them.  
What then was the beginning of their voyage,  
what danger shackled them with strong spikes of adamant?  
It was destined that Pelias die  
by the hands of Aeolus' noble sons  
or by their relentless designs.  
And a prophecy came to him  
chilling his crafty heart,  
spoken beside the navel-stone  
in the middle of treeteeming mother earth:  
to mount close guard all round  
against the man with one sandal  
when he descends from mountain lairs  
into the clear-seen land  
of famous Iolkos,  
whether stranger or citizen. And so in time  
he came, a man with two spears, stupendous;  
a double garment covered him,  
the Magnesians' native dress  
closely fitting his marvelous limbs,  
and round about it a leopard skin  
kept off the shivering rain;  
the lustrous locks of his hair  
had not been cut and lost,  
but cascaded down his entire back.  
Swiftly he went straight on,  
trying the mettle of his unshaken will,  
and in the middle of the square  
stood among the thronging crowd.  
No one knew him; but awestruck  
as they were, someone spoke thus:  
"Surely this isn't Apollo,  
nor is it bronze-charioted Ares,  
lord of Aphrodite; and they say  
that on gleaming Naxos died  
Iphimedeia's sons,  
Otos and you, daring lord Ephialtes.  
Then too Tityus fell  
hunted down by Artemis' swift arrow  
springing from her invincible quiver,  
so that a man might crave  
to caress possible loves."  
Such things they spoke in turn  
to one another; and on his polished  
mule-cart came Pelias rushing in  
pell-mell: he was at once astonished  
as he glanced uneasily at the single sandal  
conspicuous on its right foot.  
But hiding the fear in his heart  
he accosted him:  
"What country, stranger,  
do you declare your fatherland?  
And who among earth-born men  
sent you forth from her venerable womb?  
Without defiling it through hateful lies,  
tell me your race."  
With gentle words, all unperturbed,  
he answered him thus: "I say  
that I am he who bears the teaching of Chiron.  
For I come from his cave, from Chariclo and Philyra,  
where the Centaur's spotless daughters  
raised me. After completing 20 years  
without a single crooked act  
or uttering one such word to them,  
I have returned home to reclaim  
my father's ancient right of rule  
—now exercised improperly—  
which Zeus once granted  
to Aeolus, leader of the people,  
and to his sons.  
For I hear that lawless Pelias,  
following his cold, manipulative wits,  
stripped it by force from my parents,  
the legitimate sovereigns;  
when first I saw the light,  
they, fearing the violence  
of that insolent leader, darkened the house  
in mourning mixed with women's wailing,  
as if I'd died, and then secretly  
sent me away in purple swaddling-clothes,  
entrusting night with my journey,  
and gave me to Chiron,  
Cronos' son, to raise.  
Now you know the highlights of my story;  
point out plainly, my fellow citizens, the house  
of my parents, masters of white horses;  
for I am one of you, the son of Aeson,  
and come no stranger to an alien land.  
The godlike beast, whenever he addressed me,  
called me Jason."  
Thus he spoke, and as he entered  
his father's eyes recognized him;  
and from his aged eyelids  
burst the welling tears,  
for he rejoiced in his soul  
when he saw his child, the matchless,  
the fairest of men.  
And both his brothers came to them  
at news of his arrival:  
from nearby Pheres, who left the fountain Hypereia,  
and from Messene Amythaon;  
and quickly came Admetus and Melampus,  
well-wishers, to their cousin.  
Amid the feasting  
Jason welcomed them  
with honey-sweet words,  
providing them fit hospitality,  
and stretched their reveling out to plenty,  
as he reaped through five full nights  
and five days  
the holy flower of intense life.  
But, on the sixth day, telling the whole  
story soberly from the start,  
he confided it to his kinsmen,  
and they assented. Instantly he leaped  
from the couches along with them;  
and then they went to the hall of Pelias;  
bursting inside they took their stand;  
when the king heard them, he himself,  
the son of fair-haired Tyro, came to greet them;  
and Jason, distilling  
gentle discourse with a genial voice,  
laid the basis of wise words:  
"Son of Poseidon of the Rock,  
the minds of men are all too quick to praise  
deceitful gain above the right,  
though they are moving to a bitter morning after;  
but you and I ought rule  
our passions with justice  
and weave the web of future wealth.  
I speak to one who knows.  
One dam was mother to Cretheus  
and to daring-minded Salmoneus;  
and we, sprung in the third generation from them,  
look on the golden strength of the sun.  
The Fates withdraw  
if any malice comes on kinsmen  
to shroud their shame.  
It is unfitting for us two to sever  
with bronze-biting swords or spears  
the great birthright of our forefathers.  
For I give to you the flocks and tawny herds  
of cattle and all the fields,  
which you extorted from my parents  
and manage now to fatten up your wealth;  
it does not trouble me that these  
glut your house;  
but that monarchial scepter and throne  
on which, presiding once, the son of Creutheus  
guided his judgments straight  
to a race of horsemen;  
all these without our mutual strife  
surrender to me, lest from them arise  
some newer evil."  
So he spoke, and Pelias too  
responded softly: "I shall be such as you wish,  
but already the sere span of life envelops me,  
whereas your flower of youth  
is just now swelling to its crest:  
you can appease the wrath of the dead.  
For Phrixus orders us,  
proceeding to Aeëtes' palace halls,  
to bring his soul back home  
and carry off the deep-fleeced hide of the ram,  
on which he once escaped from the sea  
and from the godless weapons of his stepmother.  
A wondrous dream came speaking this to me.  
I've asked the oracle at Castalia  
if such a quest should be pursued: and it urges me  
to instantly dispatch an expedition by ship.  
Accomplish, voluntarily, this task  
and I swear that I will yield you back  
to wield sole power and to rule.  
And as a mighty pledge,  
let Zeus be witness,  
the father of both our families."  
Approving this arrangement,  
they parted company. But Jason was already  
in hot haste inciting the heralds  
to announce everywhere  
that a voyage was under way.  
Quickly came the three sons, indomitable in war,  
of Cronian Zeus  
born to round-eyed Alcmene and Leda,  
and from Pylos and Taenarus' promontory  
the two top-knotted warriors  
sprung from the Earthshaker,  
respecting their own might with awe;  
whose noble glory found fulfillment,  
that of Euphemus and yours, mighty Periclymenus.  
And from Apollo came  
the master lyrist, father of songs,  
renowned Orpheus.  
Hermes goldenwand  
sent his twin sons  
to unceasing labor on the quest,  
Echion and Erytus, flushed with youth.  
And quickly came those  
who dwelt at the base of Mount Pangaeus:  
for willingly with joyful heart  
the King of Winds, their father Boreas,  
more swiftly urged on Zetes and Cala=EFs,  
mortal men whose backs were beating  
with purple wings.  
Hera kindled in these demigods  
allsuasive sweet desire  
for the ship Argo, that none be left behind  
lingering by his mother's side  
to coddle long a life devoid of danger,  
but to discover with his agemates,  
even at the price of death,  
the fairest way to win his own exploits.  
And when the flower of sailors  
came down to Iolkos, Jason  
counted and praised d them all.  
And then the prophet Mopsus,  
divining by birds and sacred sortilege,  
embarked the army readily.  
When they had slung  
the anchors high above the beak,  
taking a golden bowl in his hands  
the captain, from the stern, called on  
the father of the Uranidae, Zeus the lightning-speared,  
for the wavesurge and the winds  
to be swift running, for the nights and sea  
paths and days to be serene,  
and for their homecoming to be fortunate;  
and from the clouds Zeus answered him  
with an auspicious clap of thunder;  
and bright bolts of lighting  
broke from the sky.  
The heroes caught their breath  
trusting the signs of the god;  
the portent-seer summoned them  
to fall to oars, announcing  
his sweet hopes;  
and the rowing ran out  
from under their swift hands insatiably.  
Conducted by the breezes of the South Wind  
they came to the mouth  
of the Inhospitable Sea,  
where they established a sacred precinct  
for Poseidon of the sea:  
there was at hand a ruddy herd of Thracian cattle  
and, newly built of stones, a hollow altar.  
Rushing now into deep danger  
they implored the Lord of Ships  
to escape the irresistible movement  
of the Clashing Rocks. For both were alive,  
and rolled more rapidly  
than battle ranks of deep-roaring winds;  
but that voyage of demigods  
finally brought their end.  
To Phasis then they came,  
where they set their might  
against the crushing Chochians  
in presence of Aeëtes himself.  
But the sovereign of swiftest darts,  
Cyprogeneia, binding  
the dappled wryneck  
four-spoked upon an indissoluble wheel  
first brought the maddening bird  
to human kind and thus taught Aeson's son  
skill in invocations and incantations,  
that he might strip Medea of all reverence  
for her parents and that Hellas, fiercely desired,  
might set her whirling, as she blazed in spirit,  
with the scourge of Persuasion.  
And she at once revealed  
the outcome of her father's trials:  
preparing then the sap of roots with oil  
for remedy against remorseless pain,  
she gave it him to anoint his limbs.  
They thus agreed by mutual consent  
to join with one another in sweet union.  
But when Aeëtes had planted in their midst  
the adamantine plow and the oxen,  
who were panting from tawny jaws  
a flame of searing fire  
and with their brazen hooves  
kept gouging up the earth in turn,  
alone he led and brought them to the yoke.  
Straight were the furrows he traced  
as he drove them up and down the ploughland,  
and cut the span of earth a fathom deep.  
Then spoke thus: "Let the king, whoever rules the ship,  
complete this task for me  
and carry off the imperishable bedding,  
the fleece gleaming with golden fringe."  
At these words, Jason threw off his saffron robe,  
and trusting to god, he set to work:  
the fire never daunted him, thanks to the orders  
of the gracious woman, all-powerful in remedies,  
but drawing out the plough,  
he bound the necks of the oxen  
in a harness of necessity,  
and thrusting into their sturdy sides  
an unwearied goad,  
the burly man completed  
his allotted span of labor. Aeëtes  
howled with inarticulate anguish  
marveling at his strength.  
Toward the mighty man his comrades  
were stretching out their hands and showering  
crowns of leaves over him  
as they greeted him with kindly words.  
And straight away the wondrous son of Helios  
told them where Phrixos' sacrificial knife  
had spread the resplendent pelt,  
but hoped that he would fail at least  
to do that task. For it lay  
within a thicket near  
the ravenous jaws of a dragon  
which, in length and breadth, exceeded  
a fifty-oared ship  
wrought by iron-nailing blows.  
Returning home by highway is too long;  
for time is pressing me  
and I know a short path:  
for many others I lead the way in skill.  
The glaring-eyed snake with speckled back,  
O Archesilaus, he slew by cunning,  
and stole with her own help Medea,  
the Peliasassassin.  
They came amid the immensity of Ocean,  
and the Red Sea,  
and the race of manslaughtering Lemnian women:  
there also in contests of their limbs  
they showed their strength for a prize cloak,  
and slept with them. In foreign  
furrows then the destined days or nights  
prosperously received the seed  
of your family's splendor:  
for there Euphemus' race was planted  
to tower up forever;  
and after sharing Spartan homes and ways  
they settled in time on the island  
once called "Fairest;"  
from there the son of Leto granted  
you the plain of Libya to enrich  
by favor of the gods  
and the holy city of golden-throned  
Cyrene to govern,  
you who contrived a craft of right counsel.  
Know now the wisdom of Oedipus:  
if someone with a sharp-bladed axe  
lopped off the branches of a mighty oak  
and marred its marvelous form,  
though desolate of fruit,  
it still gives testimony of itself,  
if ever it comes at last  
to feed the winter fire,  
or if, laid as lintel  
for a master's upright columns,  
it carries on despairing toil  
within an alien city wall,  
having left its own place empty.  
But you're the most appropriate physician  
and Paean honors you with healing light.  
One must apply a soothing hand  
to tend an ulcerous wound.  
It's easy for the almost impotent  
to shake a city;  
to set it back in place again  
is grinding conflict,  
unless a god will suddenly  
become a steersman for its leaders.  
For you is woven out this web of favors.  
Take heart to lavish full devotion  
on divinely blessed Cyrene.  
Among the sayings of Homer this one  
lay to mind and heed:  
a noble messenger, he said,  
bestows the greatest honor to each office;  
even the Muse grows strong by true report.  
Cyrene and the most illustrious house of Battus  
have come to know the upright mind  
of Damophilus. For that man—  
a youth among boys,  
but in counsels an elder  
who's gained a hundred years of life—  
bereaves an evil tongue  
of lucid voice,  
but has learned to hate the violent,  
not clashing with the noble  
or drawing out the end of any action.  
Brief is the span, for men,  
of opportunity. He knows it well;  
like an attendant, not a drudge, he follows it.  
They say this is the sharpest pain:  
to recognize the good  
but stand outside it by compulsion.  
Truly, that man is even now,  
like Atlas, wresting with the sky  
apart from fatherland apart from property.  
But Zeus eternal freed the Titans;  
in passing time,  
as winds subside, comes change  
of sails. But he prays,  
when he's exhausted this accursed affliction,  
to see his home one day,  
and by the fountain of Apollo,  
joining the symposia,  
to throw his heart into the joys of youth,  
and clasping the richly ornate lyre  
among his songwise citizens, to grasp peace,  
working harm to none nor suffering it  
from his countrymen;  
and he could tell, Archesilaus,  
what fountain of ambrosial verse he found  
when recently a guest at Thebes.

### A story by Flavius Josephus about Cyrene from Life of Josephus



But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea, and conjectured that the lands which I had in Judea would bring me no profit, because a garrison to guard the country was afterward to pitch there, he gave me another country in the plain. And when he was going away to Rome, he made choice of me to sail along with him, and paid me great respect: and when we were come to Rome, I had great care taken of me by Vespasian; for he gave me an apartment in his own house, which he lived in before he came to the empire. He also honored me with the privilege of a Roman citizen, and gave me an annual pension; and continued to respect me to the end of his life, without any abatement of his kindness to me; which very thing made me envied, and brought me into danger; for a certain Jew, whose name was Jonathan, who had raised a tumult in Cyrene, and had persuaded two thousand men of that country to join with him, was the occasion of their ruin. But when he was bound by the governor of that country, and sent to the emperor, he told him that I had sent him both weapons and money. However, he could not conceal his being a liar from Vespasian, who condemned him to die; according to which sentence he was put to death. Nay, after that, when those that envied my good fortune did frequently bring accusations against me, by God's providence I escaped them all. I also received from Vespasian no small quantity of land, as a free gift, in Judea; about which time I divorced my wife also, as not pleased with her behavior, though not till she had been the mother of three children, two of whom are dead, and one whom I named Hyrcanus, is alive. After this I married a wife who had lived at Crete, but a Jewess by birth: a woman she was of eminent parents, and such as were the most illustrious in all the country, and whose character was beyond that of most other women, as her future life did demonstrate. By her I had two sons; the elder's name was Justus, and the next Simonides, who was also named Agrippa. And these were the circumstances of my domestic affairs. However, the kindness of the emperor to me continued still the same; for when Vespasian was dead, Titus, who succeeded him in the government, kept up the same respect for me which I had from his father; and when I had frequent accusations laid against me, he would not believe them. And Domitian, who succeeded, still augmented his respects to me; for he punished those Jews that were my accusers, and gave command that a servant of mine, who was a eunuch, and my accuser, should be punished. He also made that country I had in Judea tax free, which is a mark of the greatest honor to him who hath it; nay, Domitia, the wife of Caesar, continued to do me kindnesses. And this is the account of the actions of my whole life; and let others judge of my character by them as they please. But to thee, O Epaphroditus,^[Of this Epaphroditus, see the note on the Preface to the Antiquities.] thou most excellent of men! do I dedicate all this treatise of our Antiquities; and so, for the present, I here conclude the whole.[^dbc645b06dbf4ade9816797ff4dd78d3]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Ferentinum from Historiae



Thus Otho ended his life in the 37th year of his age. He came from the municipal town of Ferentinum. His father was of consular, his grandfather of prætorian rank. His family on the mother's side was of less distinction, but yet respectable. What his boyhood and his youth had been, we have already shewn. By two daring acts, one most atrocious, the other singularly noble, he earned in the eyes of posterity about an equal share of infamy and of glory. I should think it unbecoming the dignity of the task which I^[EMBARRASSMENT OF SENATE] have undertaken, to collect fabulous marvels, and to amuse with fiction the tastes of my readers; at the same time I would not venture to impugn the credit of common report and tradition. The natives of these parts relate that on the day when the battle was being fought at Bedriacum, a bird of unfamiliar appearance settled in a much frequented grove near Regium Lepidum, and was not frightened or driven away by the concourse of people, or by the multitude of birds that flocked round it, until Otho killed himself; then it vanished. When they came to compute the time, it was found that the commencement and the end of this strange occurrence tallied with the last scenes of Otho's life.[^cd5967def7ad4bc398485d8e7b9f19d7]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Casinum from Philippics



But the fact that the same man finds fault with my melancholy, and also with my jokes, is a great proof that I was very moderate in each particular.

You have said that no inheritances come to me. Would that this accusation of yours were a true one; I should have more of my friends and connections alive. But how could such a charge ever come into your head? For I have received more than twenty millions of sesterces in inheritances. Although in this particular I admit that you have been more fortunate than I. No one has ever made me his heir except he was a friend of mine, in order that my grief of mind for his loss might be accompanied also with some gain, if it was to be considered as such.

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Minturnae from For Plancius



Allow that you were more worthy than Plancius (though that point I will contest with you presently, though without at all disparaging your pretensions or character,) still allow that you were more worthy, yet it is not your competitor by whom you have been defeated, but the people by whom you have been passed over, that is in fault.

And in this affair you ought to recollect that at all _comitia_, and especially at those held for the election of aediles, it is the party spirit of the people, and not their deliberate judgment which bears sway, that their votes are coaxed out of them not extorted by merit, that the voters are more apt to consider what obligations they themselves are under to each individual, than what benefits the republic has received at his hands. But if you insist on it that it is their deliberate judgment, then you must not annul it but bear it.[^90295f06516d4b5aae62a4e571e8db9a]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Casinum from On the Agrarian Law



The fortieth clause of the law is one, O Romans, the mention of which I have hitherto purposely avoided, lest I should seem to be reopening a wound of the republic which was now scarred over, or to be renewing, at a most unseasonable time, some of our old dissensions. And now too I will argue that point, not because I do not think that this present condition of the republic deserving of being most zealously maintained, especially after I have professed myself to be for this year at least the patron of all tranquillity and unanimity in the republic; but in order to teach Rullus for the future to be silent at least in those matters with respect to which he wishes silence to be observed as to himself and his actions.[^820ffd500cf9436781d78b15b4bb35fa]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Minturnae from Against Piso



Was I, forsooth, anxious to lean on the counsel or protection of that piece of senseless cattle, of that bit of rotten flesh? was I likely to seek for any support or ornament for myself from that contemptible carcass? I suppose I was looking for a consul, I say, but one (that I was not likely to find in that hog) who might uphold the cause of the republic with his dignity and wisdom, not one who like a stock or like a trunk of a tree, if he only stood upright, might maintain the title of consul. For as the whole of my cause was the cause of a consul and of the senate, I had need of the assistance of the consul and senate; one of which sources of aid was even turned by you when you were consuls to my injury; the other was entirely suspended, if not abolished in the republic.

But if you ask what were my intentions; I would not have yielded, and the republic should still have retained me in its embrace, if I had only had to contend with contemptible gladiators,^[The Latin is _bustuarius_; literally, one who fights at the funeral pile in honour of the dead.] and with you, and with your colleague. For the cause of that most admirable man Quintus Metellus was a wholly different one; a citizen whom, in my opinion, I consider equal in glory to the immortal gods;[^8b57753c1f314a3388739d4d91358e45]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Minturnae from Historiae



The fleet at Misenum, so much can be done in times of civil discord by the daring of even a single man, was drawn into revolt by Claudius Faventinus, a centurion cashiered by Galba, who forged letters in the name of Vespasian offering a reward for treachery. The fleet was under the command of Claudius Apollinaris, a man neither firm in his loyalty, nor energetic in his treason. Apinius Tiro, who had filled the office of prætor, and who then happened to be at Minturnæ, offered to head the revolt. By these men the colonies and municipal towns were drawn into the movement, and as Puteoli was particularly zealous for Vespasian, while Capua on the other hand remained loyal to Vitellius, they introduced their municipal jealousy into the civil war. Claudius Julianus, who had lately exercised an indulgent rule over the fleet at Misenum, was selected by Vitellius to soothe the irritation of the soldiery. He was supported by a city cohort and a troop of gladiators whose chief officer he was. As soon as the two camps were pitched, Julianus, without much hesitation, went over to the side of Vespasian, and they then occupied Tarracina, which was protected by its fortifications and position rather than by any ability of theirs.[^397d087c72534fdbb6628a54752cd27b]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Casinum from Philippics



But you have dared besides (what is there which you would not dare?) to say that the Capito line Hill, when I was consul was full of aimed slaves. I was offering violence to the senate, I suppose, in order to compel the adoption of those infamous decrees of the senate. O wretched man, whether those things are not known to you (for you know nothing that is good), or whether they are, when you dare to speak so shamelessly before such men! For what Roman knight was there, what youth of noble birth except you, what man of any rank or class who recollected that he was a citizen, who was not on the Capitoline Hill while the senate was assembled in this temple? who was there, who did not give in his name? Although there could not be provided checks enough, nor were the books able to contain their names.[^d80a8212c8b747e6bad943da0860cb26]

But the fact that the same man finds fault with my melancholy, and also with my jokes, is a great proof that I was very moderate in each particular.

You have said that no inheritances come to me. Would that this accusation of yours were a true one; I should have more of my friends and connections alive. But how could such a charge ever come into your head? For I have received more than twenty millions of sesterces in inheritances. Although in this particular I admit that you have been more fortunate than I. No one has ever made me his heir except he was a friend of mine, in order that my grief of mind for his loss might be accompanied also with some gain, if it was to be considered as such.

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Minturnae from For Plancius



Allow that you were more worthy than Plancius (though that point I will contest with you presently, though without at all disparaging your pretensions or character,) still allow that you were more worthy, yet it is not your competitor by whom you have been defeated, but the people by whom you have been passed over, that is in fault.

And in this affair you ought to recollect that at all _comitia_, and especially at those held for the election of aediles, it is the party spirit of the people, and not their deliberate judgment which bears sway, that their votes are coaxed out of them not extorted by merit, that the voters are more apt to consider what obligations they themselves are under to each individual, than what benefits the republic has received at his hands. But if you insist on it that it is their deliberate judgment, then you must not annul it but bear it.[^4787a83c823f4aaa83f7b47ab24b8a80]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Formiae from Vitellius



He was sent by Galba into Lower Germany,^[A.U.C. 821] contrary to his expectation. It is supposed that he was assisted in procuring this appointment by the interest of Titus Junius, a man of great influence at that time; whose friendship he had long before gained by favouring the same set of charioteers with him in the Circensian games. But Galba openly declared that none were less to be feared than those who only cared for their bellies, and that even his enormous appetite must be satisfied with the plenty of that province; so that it is evident he was selected for that government more out of contempt than kindness. It is certain, that when he was to set out, he had not money for the expenses of his journey; he being at that time so much straitened in his circumstances, that he was obliged to put his wife and children, whom he left at Rome, into a poor lodging which he hired for them, in order that he might let his own house for the remainder of the year; and he pawned a pearl taken from his mother's ear-ring, to defray his expenses on the road. A crowd of creditors who were waiting to stop him, and amongst them the people of Sineussa and Formia, whose taxes he had converted to his own use, he eluded, by alarming them with the apprehension of false accusations. He had, however, sued a certain freedman, who was clamorous in demanding a debt of him, under pretence that he had kicked him; which action he would not withdraw, until he had wrung from the freedman fifty thousand sesterces. Upon his arrival in the province, the army, which was disaffected to Galba, and ripe for insurrection, received him with open arms, as if he had been sent them from heaven. It was no small recommendation to their favour, that he was the son of a man who had been thrice consul, was in the prime of life, and of an easy, prodigal disposition. This opinion, which had been long entertained of him, Vitellius confirmed by some late practices; having kissed all the common soldiers whom he met with upon the road, and been excessively complaisant in the inns and stables to the muleteers and travellers; asking them in a morning, if they had got their breakfasts, and letting them see, by belching, that he had eaten his.[^8e7b24361b4241f79fa4d89361b28dc9]

### A story by E. T. Merrill about Formiae from Commentary on Catullus



55\. A few of the persons distinguished by the love or by the hatred of Catullus may conveniently be mentioned here. Some such persons, however, as Caesar, Cicero, and Clodius, are so well known otherwise to the ordinary reader as to need no biographical notice in a work of this sort. Others, like Lesbia, nave been sufficiently noticed in previous paragraphs of this Introduction. Still others are of so little present importance, or are so little known to us outside the mention of them by Catullus, that the brief references to them in the commentary on the individual poems may suffice. The names of all these, with references to the poems in which they are addressed or mentioned, may be found in the Index of Proper Names at the end of this volume.

56\. It is a temptation to identify the Alfenus to whom the remonstrance of c. 30 is addressed with P. Alfenus Varus, _consul suffectus_ 39 B.C., especially if he, in turn, can be identified with the Alfenus Varus who protected Vergil's property at Mantua (Ecl. 1, 6, 9), who was perhaps a native of Cremona (though falsely identified by the scholiasts on Horace with _Alfenus vafer_ of Sat. 1.3.130). For if Varus was at Cremona during the winter and spring of 55-54 B.C., while Catullus was at Verona (cf. § 40), we perhaps have a key to the difference in tone between c. 30 and c. 38. From Cornificius at Rome the poet could expect in his growing illness only written comfort, and that is all he asks. Alfenus Varus at Cremona was within easy reaching distance of Verona by a direct highway, the Via Postumia, and might have visited Catullus in person, but did not. Hence the deeper feeling of slight with which Catullus addresses him.

57\. The 'Pollio frater' of c. 12.6 is very likely the only Pollio known to us from this period, C. Asinius, Cn. f. (born 75 B.C., died 5 A.D.), who became praetor in 45 B.C. and consul in 40, in which year he gained a triumph over the Parthini. At first a Caesarian, he might have been won over to the senatorial party after Caesar's death, but finally cast in his lot with Antonius, from whom, however, he became alienated, but without entering the circle of the intimate friends of Augustus. As orator, dramatic and lyric poet, historian of the first triumvirate, and literary critic, he gained lasting fame, and is frequently quoted by succeeding writers. Among his intimate friends were Vergil and Horace; cf. Verg. Ecl. 3.84; 4; 8.6; Hor. Carm. II. 1; Sat. 1.10.42, 85.

58\. Nothing further is known of the older brother of Pollio addressed in c. 12. The family of the Asinii sprang from Teate, the capital of the Marrucini, but it is doubtful whether Marrucine in c. 12.1 is simply a distinguishing epithet. C. Asinius Pollio is the first of the family known to bear a cognomen, and perhaps that custom was introduced in his generation, his elder brother taking the cognomen Marrucinus from the seat of the family.

59\. The Caelius of c. 58 is probably identical with the Caelius of cc. 82 and 100, and with the Rufus of cc. 69 and 77 (and also cc. 73 and 59?), the names and circumstances suggesting M. Caelius Rufus, born, according to Pliny (N.H 7.165), on the same day with C. Licinius Calvus, May 28, 82 B.C. (though perhaps this date is too late, by a few years, for the birth of Caelius). Caelius is well known as an ambitious politician and an orator (Cic. Brut. 79.273; Quint. Inst. VI. 3.69; X. 1. 115; 2.25; Tac. Dial. 18, 21, 25). He was at first a partisan of the optimates; but after filling the offices of tribune (52 B.C.), quaestor, and curule aedile (50 B.C.), and contracting immense debts by his extravagant life, he became a follower of Caesar, and was by him made praetor for the year 48. But being shortly thereafter deposed for attempts at revolutionary legislation, he tried to seduce certain of Caesar's troops, and was finally killed under the walls of Thurii. He was an active and interesting correspondent of Cicero, by whom he was defended (56 B.C.) in the famous speech pro Caelio against the charge of attempted poisoning brought by Clodia (Lesbia), whose favored lover he had been. He himself appears to have broken this connection, and perhaps to have opened the eyes of Catullus to Lesbia's real character, after which the friend-ship was again cemented between him and Catullus which had been severed by their rivalry (cf. §§ 25, 26). The poems addressed to him were apparently written in about the following order: cc. 100, 82, 77, (73), 69, (59), 58

60\. C. Licinius Macer Calvus, apparently the most intimate friend of Catullus, was the son of the annalist, Licinius Macer and was born May 28, 82 B.C. (cf. Plin. l.c.). He died in, or not very long before, the year 47 B.C. (cf. Cic. Fam. XV. 21.4). He was renowned as a most able and skilful orator, though of low stature (cf. 53.5; Sen. Contr. VII. 4.7; Ov. Trist. II.431), and as a writer of epic, lyric, and epigram (cf. Cic. Brut. 279, 283; Tac. Dial.18; Quint. Inst. 10.1.115; Plin. Ep. I. 16. 5; Gell. XIX. 9.7; Serv. on Verg. Ecl. 6.47; 8.4) - On account of his intimacy with Catullus and the similarity of their political principles (cf. Suet. Iul. 73) and of their writings they are often named together (cf. with above Hor. Sat. I. 10. 19, and indexes to Propertius and Ovid). The few extant fragments of his works are appended to the editions of Catullus by Lachmann and L. Muiller. The death of Quintilia, apparently from the tone of c.96 the wife of Calvus, gave occasion for one of the finest and most touching of the briefer poems of Catullus.

61\. The Cornificius to whom Catullus addressed the pathetic appeal of c. 38 was a poet (cf. vv. 7 and 8), and is doubtless to be identified with the Cornificius mentioned by Ovid (Trist. II.436) in connection with other verse-writers of the period of Catullus. It is not so clear, though quite possible, that he is the Q. Cornificius to whom Cicero wrote friendly letters (Fam. XII. 17-30), dated between 45 and 43 B.C. This Cornificius was an active officer of Julius Caesar, a member of the college of augurs, and later governor of the province of Africa, which he endeavored to hold against T. Sextius, the general of the second triumvirate. His death is mentioned by Jerome under date of 41 B.C.: Cornificius poeta a militibus desertus interiit, quos saepe fugientes 'galeatos lepores' adpellarat. Jerome If this be the friend of Catullus, he may perhaps be counted as another of the group of young writers won over by Caesar from the ranks of his political foes. His interest and activity in rhetorical studies are distinctly indicated by Cicero, and there seems to be no good reason to doubt that he is the Cornificius rhetor not infrequently quoted by Quintilian. With but slightly less probability may be attributed to him the work on the derivation of the names of the gods ascribed by Macrobius and Priscian to an author of his name: but the verse in criticism of a grammatical point in Vergil attributed by Cledonius (V. 43.2) to Cornificius Gallus may have been written, as some have thought, by Cornelius Gallus. Only two fragments of the verses of Cornificius have been preserved, one a hendecasyllabic (Macr. VI. 4. 12), and the other the latter part of a hexameter from his Glaucus (Macr. VI. 5. 13). They are appended by L. Müller to his edition of Catullus.

62\. The Cato to whom c. 56 is addressed was probably not that pattern of ancient Roman strictness, M. Porcius Cato, later called Uticensis, but the grammarian, Valenus Cato, who was a countryman of Catullus (Suet. Gram. I i), and whose amatory poems are mentioned by Ovid (Trist. II.436) in connection with those of Cinna (cf. § 63), Cornificius (cf. § 61), and Anser.

63\. C. Helvius Cinna, a companion of Catullus on the staff of Memmius (cf. c. 10.30 and § 30), whose epic poem, the Zmyrna, is praised in c. 95, was probably the Caesarian tribune mistaken for L. Cornelius Cinna, the anti-Caesarian, in the riots attending the funeral of Julius Caesar, and killed by the populace (Plut. Brut. 20, Iul.68; Suet. Iul.85; cf. Shakspere Jul. Caes.III. 3). The insignificant extant fragments of his poems are appended by L. Muller to his edition of Catullus.

64\. The Cornelius of c. 1.1 seems to be Cornelius Nepos, the historian; witness Ausonius, who says (XXIII. 1-3) 'Cui ... libellum' Veronensis ait poeta quondam, inventoque dedit statim Nepoti . Nepos (circ. 94-24 B.C.) was certainly a provincial from Cisalpine Gaul ( Plin. N. H. 3.127 Nepos Padi accola ), and probably a native of Ticinum (Plin. Ep. IV. 28.1; Mommsen in Hermes III. p.62). His acquaintance with Catullus, though nothing certain can be traced concerning it was doubtless fostered by their similarity of origin (cf. § 12). Nepos was author not only of the work De Viris Illustribus, of which a part, with lives of Cato and of Atticus, is still extant, but also of other historical works (cf. c. 1.6 n.) and of poems (Plin. Ep. V. 3. 6).

65\. Q. Hortensius Ortulus (114-50 B.C.), Cicero>'s greatest rival as an orator, was also somewhat of a historian (Vell. II. 16. 3), and wrote erotic poems (Ov. Trist. II.441; Plin. Ep. V. 3. 5), which the Greeks at the banquet of Antonius Julianus (Gell. XIX. 9.7) characterized as _invenusta_, though they admitted that Catullus and Calvus wrote some verses comparable with those of Anacreon. Presuming, perhaps, upon his own gifts as a poet, Hortensius asked Catullus for a poem (c. 65.18-19), and the poet complied with the request, though with an absence of compliment that indicates no intimate friendship with his petitioner, whose much greater age and high position gave him, however, the power to become an influential patron. That the friendship made no progress seems to be indicated by the uncomplimentary allusion to the verses of Hortensius in c. 95.3 (cf. however § 25 ad fin.).

66\. The Varus of c. 10 is apparently identical with the Varus of c. 22, who is a friend of Catullus and a critic of poetry, if not a poet himself. This may well be the distinguished Quintilius Varus, the Augustan critic (Hor. AP. 438 ff.) and poet (Acro and Comm. Cruq. on l.c.). He is called a native of Cremona; and his death in 23 B.C. (according to Jerome) drew from Horace a touching address of sympathy to Vergil (Carm. 1.24). Judged from the tone of the passage in the Ars Poetica , Quintilius must have been somewhat older than Horace, while yet he could hardly have been born long, if at all, before Catullus. The attempt to identify the Varus of c. 10 and c. 2 with Alfenus Varus of c. 30 is unsatisfactory.

67\. The Manlius Torquatus, whose marriage with Vinia Aurunculeia is celebrated in c. 61, was perhaps the L. Manlius Torquatus whose father was consul in 65 B.C. (cf. Hor. Carm. III.21., Epod. 13.6), and who was himself praetor in 49. He allied himself with the Pompeians, and was killed in Africa in 47 (cf. Bell. Afr. 96). In 62 B.C. Manlius prosecuted P. Cornelius Sulla on the charge of conspiracy with Catiline. Cicero and Hortensius appeared for the defence and secured an acquittal. In Cicero's speech on that occasion (Pro Sulla), and especially in his Brutus (76. 265), Manlius is highly praised.

68\. A certain Veranius is mentioned in cc. 12, 28, and 47 in connection with a Fabullus, evidently an intimate friend of his, as both were of Catullus. Beside these three references to them jointly, c. 9 is addressed to Veranius alone, and c. 13 to Fabullus alone, the equal recognition thus scrupulously given them by Catullus suggesting the existence of a close bond of intimacy between the two friends. Nothing more is known of them than can be gathered from Catullus himself. Veranius has in c. 9 just returned from a residence in Spain, and in c. 12 the presence there of Fabullus also is noted. The 13th poem, too, a jesting reference to a prospective dinner offered Fabullus, appears to have been written while Fabullus was absent somewhere, or had just returned, and may well refer to the same occasion as c. 9, the different tone of the individual poems, one sportive, and one affectionate, corresponding to characteristic differences in the dispositions of the two friends. In cc. 28 and 47 Veranius and Fabullus have been away from Rome as members of the retinue of a certain Piso, a provincial governor. They returned to Rome apparently not long after the time of the return of Catullus himself from Bithynia (56 B.C.; cf. § 31 ff.).

69\. If, then, there be such a connection as indicated between cc. 9 and 13, the absence in Spain cannot have been that with Piso, and must have preceded it by several years; for the reference to Lesbia in c. 13.11 clearly antedates the break of Catullus with her, and that occurred before his journey to Bithynia. But it is not incredible that two friends so intimately connected as Veranius and Fabullus should have been together on more than one journey after fortune; and the journey to Spain like the later one with Piso (cf. § 70) may well have been on the staff of a provincial governor, - probably about 60 B.C., as the reference to Lesbia indicates (cf c. 13.11 n.).

70\. The Piso unfavorably commented upon in cc. 28 and 47 (cf. § 68) is probably L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul in 58 B.C. (the year of Cicero's exile), and in 57-55 governor of Macedonia, where he made an honorable record. After his return to Rome in 55 B.C. he attempted to reply to certain strictures of Cicero uttered in his absence, and drew down upon himself the overwhelming invective power of his adversary in the famous speech In Pisonem, in which the whole life, character, and actions of Piso were held up to undeserved obloquy.

71\. The service of Catullus on the staff of C. Memmius, governor of Bithynia, has already been discussed (§ 29 ff.). Concerning Memmius himself we may add further that neither his political nor his personal character was above reproach. He was in 54 B.C. party to a most barefaced attempt to secure the consulship by bribing the consuls of that year (Cic. Att. IV. 18. 2), and was charged with the seduction of the wives of Lucullus (Cic. Att. I. 18. 3) and Pompey (Suet. Gram 14). He appears to better advantage as a scholar and the patron of literary men, especially of Lucretius, who dedicated his great poem to him. Cicero (Brut. 70.247) speaks well of his Greek scholarship, and of his ability in oratory, though blaming him for lack of application. Accused of _ambitus_ in 53 B.C., on account of the operations of the preceding year, he went into exile in Greece (cf. Cic. Fam. XIII.1), where he died about the year 49.

72\. Prominent among the invective poems of Catullus is a group directed against a certain Gellius. This comprises cc. 74, 80, 88, 89, 90, 91, 116, but the poems are not arranged in chronological order. Apparently the earliest in composition is c. 16, and the second c. 91,-- the first indicating that Catullus had tried to avert the hostility of Gellius by sending him translations from Callimachus, but declaring from that time open war, while the second asserts that Gellius had broken the bond of friendship with Catullus by becoming a lover of Lesbia. In c. 80.1 the youth of Gellius is indicated, and in all the series except c. 116 he is charged with various abhorrent crimes. The most acceptable suggestion of his identity was originally made by Pantagathus († 1578), who judged him to be that son of L. Gellius Publicola (consul 72 B.C.) who is said by Valerius Maximus (V. 9.1) to have been accused before the senate of in novercam (cf. c. 88.1, etc.) commissum stuprum et parricidium cogitatum. This younger Gellius was himself consul in 36 B.C., and his age therefore also accords with the intimations of Catullus. The _patruus_ of c. 74 is identified by some critics with the Gellius Publicola attacked by Cicero in Pro Sestio 51. 110, while yet others have supposed, but with no sufficient reason, that this Gellius, and not the one of Valerius Maximus, is the Gellius assailed by Catullus.

73\. The attacks of Catullus upon Mamurra have already been mentioned (§ 38). That he is identical with the 'Mentula' of cc. 94, 105, 114, and 115 we may be tolerably certain on noting the use of that name for Mamurra in c. 29.13, and on comparing the wealth and extravagance of the two men (cc. 114 and 115 with cc. 29, 41, and 43), their literary pretensions (c. 105 with c. 57.7), and their licentiousness (cc. 94 and 115.7-8 with cc. 29.7-8 and 57) - These latter indications, however, but support that of c. 29.13, and would not independently establish the identity.

74\. A sufficient biography of Mamurra is given by Pliny (N. H. XXXVI. 6.48), who says he was an _eques_ of Formiae and _praefectus fabrum_ of Caesar in Gaul, and quotes Nepos as authority for the statement that Mamurra first of the Romans incrusted the entire walls of his house on the Caelian with marble, and had within it none but solid marble columns. Cicero, too, mentions Mamurra's ill-gotten wealth (Att. VII. 7.6), and in Att.XIII. 52. 1 (written in 45 B.C.) refers to the calm way in which Caesar received news of his death (so Nipperdey interprets the allusion). The connection of Mamurra with the provincial Ameana (cc. 41, 43) may be assigned to the time when he was in attendance upon Caesar in his winter journeys to the nearer province.

75\. The poet Volusius of cc. 36 and 95 is probably not to be identified with Tanusius Geminus, as Muretus and other later writers would have it. The only ground for such identification is a remark made by Seneca ( Ep. 93.11 annales Tanusii scis quam ponderosi sint et quid vocentur ). But of all the names that appear in Catullus, Lesbia and Lesbius are the only ones known to be pseudonyms (for Mentula is hardly a name, but an easily recognized epithet). And the quid vocentur of Seneca may readily refer to some other popular characterization of the work of the annalist, and not to the cacata charta of c. 36.1.[^b781d4c3d25a4ac3a5516368d0722d33]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Cosa from Against Verres



He thanks the men and praises their good-will and diligence in his behalf. He himself, inflamed with wickedness and frenzy, comes into the forum. His eyes glared; cruelty was visible in his whole countenance. All men waited to see what does he was going to take,—what he was going to do; when all of a sudden he orders the man to be seized, and to be stripped and bound in the middle of the forum, and the rods to be got ready. The miserable man cried out that he was a Roman citizen, a citizen, also, of the municipal town of Cosa,—that he had served with Lucius Pretius a most illustrious Roman knight, who was living as a trader at Panormus, and from whom Verres might know that he was speaking the truth. Then Verres says that he has ascertained that he had been sent into Sicily by the leaders of the runaway slaves, in order to act as a spy; a matter as to which there was no witness, no trace, nor even the slightest suspicion in the mind of any one.[^81bc3c6a160048fe9d9c50176603f2fb]

In the meantime Milo, having despatched letters to all the colonies and free towns, intimating that what he did was in virtue of Pompey's authority, who had sent him orders by Bibulus, endeavored to draw over the debtors to his party. But not succeeding in his design, he contented himself with setting some slaves at liberty, and with them marched to besiege Cosa, in the territory of Turinum. Q. Paedius the pretor, with a garrison of one legion, commanded in the town: and here Milo was slain by a stone from a machine on the walls. Caelius giving out that he was gone to Caesar, came to Thurium, where endeavouring to debauch the inhabitants, and corrupt by promises of money the Spanish and Gaulish horse, whom Caesar had sent thither to garrison the place, they slew him. Thus these dangerous beginnings, that by reason of the multiplicity of affairs wherewith the magistrates were distracted, and the ticklish situation of the times, threatened great revolutions, and alarmed all Italy, were brought to a safe and speedy issue.[^a57ad9f6226044988d9f07e490dea4a1]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Cosa from Divus Vespasianus



Vespasian was born in the country of the Sabines, between the Reate, and a little country-seat called Phalacrine, upon the fifth of the calends of December [27th November], in the evening, in the consulship of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus and Caius Poppaeus Sabinus, five years before the death of Augustus;^[A.U.C. 762. A.D. 10] and was educated under the care of Tertulla, his grandmother by the father's side, upon an estate belonging to the family, at Cosa.^[Cosa was a place in the Volscian territory; of which Anagni was probably the chief town. It lies about forty miles to the north-east of Rome.] After his advancement to the empire, he used frequently to visit the place where he had spent his infancy; and the villa was continued in the same condition, that he might see every thing about him just as he had been used to do. And he had so great a regard for the memory of his grandmother, that, upon solemn occasions and festival days, he constantly drank out of a silver cup which she had been accustomed to use. After assuming the manly habit, he had a long time a distaste for the senatorian toga, though his brother had obtained it- nor could he be persuaded by any one but his mother to sue for that badge of honour. She at length drove him to it, more by taunts and reproaches, than by entreaties and authority, calling him now and then, by way of reproach, his brother's footman. He served as military tribune in Thrace. When made quaestor, the province of Crete and Cyrene fell to him by lot. He was candidate for the aedileship, and soon after for the praetorship, but met with a repulse in the former case; though at last, with much difficulty, he came in sixth on the poll-books. But the office of praetor he carried upon his first canvass, standing amongst the highest at the poll. Being incensed against the senate, and desirous to gain, by all possible means, the good graces of Caius,^[Caligula] he obtained leave to exhibit extraordinary^[These games were extraordinary, as being out of the usual course of those given by praetors. ] games for the emperor's victory in Germany, and advised them to increase the punishment of the conspirators against his life, by exposing their corpses unburied. He likewise gave him thanks in that august assembly for the honour of being admitted to his table.[^86a8412915d94a4b862a4f20ffd67b38]

### A story by Pausanias, fl. ca. 150-175 about Pisae from Description of Greece



Enough of my discussion of this question. Heracles afterwards took Elis and sacked it, with an army he had raised of Argives, Thebans and Arcadians. The Eleans were aided by the men of Pisa and of Pylus in Elis. The men of Pylus were punished by Heracles, but his expedition against Pisa was stopped by an oracle from Delphi to this effectMy father cares for Pisa, but to me in the hollows of Pytho.^[Hermann's emendation would mean: "but unto me be assigned Pytho."]This oracle proved the salvation of Pisa. To Phyleus Heracles gave up the land of Elis and all the rest, more out of respect for Phyleus than because he wanted to do so: he allowed him to keep the prisoners, and Augeas to escape punishment.

The women of Elis, it is said, seeing that their land had been deprived of its vigorous manhood, prayed to Athena that they might conceive at their first union with their husbands. Their prayer was answered, and they set up a sanctuary of Athena surnamed Mother. Both wives and husbands were so delighted at their union that they named the place itself, where they first met, Bady (sweet), and the river that runs thereby Bady Water, this being a word of their native dialect.

When Phyleus had returned to Dulichium after organizing the affairs of Elis, Augeas died at an advanced age, and the kingdom of Elis devolved on Agasthenes, the son of Augeas, and on Amphimachus and Thalpius. For the sons of Actor married twin sisters, the daughters of Dexamenus who was king at Olenus; Amphimachus was born to one son and Theronice, Thalpius to her sister Theraephone and Eurytus.

However, neither Amarynceus himself nor his son Diores remained common people. Incidentally this is shown by Homer^[Hom. Il. 2.622] in his list of the Eleans; he makes their whole fleet to consist of forty ships, half of them under the command of Amphimachus and Thalpius, and of the remaining twenty he puts ten under Diores, the son of Amarynceus, and ten under Polyxenus, the son of Agasthenes. Polyxenus came back safe from Troy and begat a son, Amphimachus. This name I think Polyxenus gave his son because of his friendship with Amphimachus, the son of Cteatus, who died at Troy.

Amphimachus begat Eleius, and it was while Eleius was king in Elis that the assembly of the Dorian army under the sons of Aristomachus took place, with a view to returning to the Peloponnesus. To their kings was delivered this oracle, that they were to choose the "one with three eyes" to lead them on their return. When they were at a loss as to the meaning of the oracle, they were met by a man driving a mule, which was blind of one eye.

Cresphontes inferred that this was the man indicated by the oracle, and so the Dorians made him one of themselves. He urged them to descend upon the Peloponnesus in ships, and not to attempt to go across the Isthmus with a land army. Such was his advice, and at the same time he led them on the voyage from Naupactus to Molycrium. In return they agreed to give him at his request the land of Elis. The man was Oxylus, son of Haemon, the son of Thoas. This was the Thoas who helped the sons of Atreus to destroy the empire of Priam, and from Thoas to Aetolus the son of Endymion are six generations.

There were ties of kindred between the Heracleidae and the kings of Aetolia; in particular the mothers of Thoas, the son of Andraemon, and of Hyllus, the son of Heracles, were sisters. It fell to the lot of Oxylus to be an outlaw from Aetolia. The story goes that as he was throwing the quoit he missed the mark and committed unintentional homicide. The man killed by the quoit, according to one account, was Thermius, the brother of Oxylus; according to another it was Alcidocus, the son of Scopius.[^63ecc7b94d4548c48385237420f1491d]

Virgil departed from Pisae, intending to travel by ship, down the coast to Luna, a 36.177462362 mile journey. 

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Nor found they room for hope; for nature gave  
Unerring portents of worse ills to come.  
The angry gods filled earth and air and sea  
With frequent prodigies; in darkest nights  
Strange constellations sparkled through the gloom:  
The pole was all afire, and torches flew  
Across the depths of heaven; with horrid hair  
A blazing comet stretched from east to west  
And threatened change to kingdoms. From the blue  
Pale lightning flashed, and in the murky air  
The fire took divers shapes; a lance afar  
Would seem to quiver or a misty torch;  
A noiseless thunderbolt from cloudless sky  
Rushed down, and drawing fire in northern parts  
Plunged on the summit of the Alban mount.  
The stars that run their courses in the void  
Of night, came forth at noontide, and the moon  
Whose orb complete gave back her brother's rays,  
Hid by the shade of earth, grew pale and wan.  
The sun himself, when poised in mid career,  
Shrouded his burning car in blackest gloom  
And plunged the world in darkness, so that men  
Despaired of day-like as he veiled his light  
From that fell banquet^[Compare Ben Jonson's ' Catiline,' I. 1: Lecca. The day goes back, Or else my senses. Cirius. As at Atreus' feast.] which Mycenae saw.  
The day goes back,  
Or else my senses.  
As at Atreus' feast.  
The jaws of Etna were agape with flame  
That rose not heavenwards, but headlong fell  
In smoking stream upon th' Italian flank.  
Then black Charybdis, from her boundless depth,  
Threw up a gory sea. In piteous tones  
Howled the wild dogs; the Vestal fire was snatched  
From off the altar; and the flame that crowned  
The Latin festival was split in twain,  
As on the Theban pyre,^[When the Theban brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, were being burned on the same pyre, the flame shot up in two separate tongues, indicating that even in death they could not be reconciled. (Mr. Haskins' note, citing Statius, 'Theb.')] in ancient days;  
Earth tottered on its base: the mighty Alps  
From off their summits shook th' eternal snow.^['Shook the old snow from off their trembling laps.' (Marlowe.) The Latin word is jugis.]  
In huge upheaval Ocean raised his waves  
O'er Calpe's rock and Atlas' hoary head.  
The native gods shed tears, and holy sweat  
Dropped from the idols; gifts in temples fell:  
Foul birds defiled the day; beasts left the woods  
And made their lair among the streets of Rome.  
All this we hear; nay more: dumb oxen spake;  
Monsters were brought to birth and mothers shrieked  
At their own offspring; words of dire import  
From Cumae's prophetess were noised abroad.  
Bellona's priests with bleeding arms, and slaves  
Of Cybele's worship, with ensanguined hair,  
Howled chants of havoc and of woe to men.  
Arms clashed; and sounding in the pathless woods  
Were heard strange voices; spirits walked the earth:  
And dead men's ashes muttered from the urn.  
Those who live near the walls desert their homes,  
For lo! with hissing serpents in her hair,  
Waving in downward whirl a blazing pine,  
A fiend patrols the town, like that which erst  
At Thebes urged on Agave,^[Book VI., 420.] or which hurled  
Lycurgus' bolts, or that which as he came  
From Hades seen, at haughty Juno's word,  
Brought terror to the soul of Hercules.  
Trumpets like those that summon armies forth  
Were heard re-echoing in the silent night:  
And from the earth arising Sulla's^[Sulla was buried in the Campus Martius. (Plutarch, ' Sulla,'38.) The corpse of Marius was dragged from his tomb by Sulla's order, and thrown into the Anio.] ghost  
Sang gloomy oracles, and by Anio's wave  
All fled the homesteads, frighted by the shade  
Of Marius waking from his broken tomb.  
In such dismay they summon, as of yore,  
The Tuscan sages to the nation's aid.  
Aruns, the eldest, leaving his abode  
In desolate Luca,^[It would seem that Luna is the better reading. (Dante, ' Inferno,'xx. 46.] came, well versed in all  
The lore of omens; knowing what may mean  
The flight of hovering bird, the pulse that beats  
In offered victims, and the levin bolt.  
All monsters first, by most unnatural birth  
Brought into being, in accursed flames  
He bids consume. Then round the walls of Rome^[Such a ceremonial took place in A.D. 56 under Nero, after the temples of Jupiter and Minerva had been struck by lightning, and was probably witnessed by Lucan himself. (See Merivale's 'History of the Roman Empire,' chapter lii.)]  
Each trembling citizen in turn proceeds.  
The priests, chief guardians of the public faith,  
With holy sprinkling purge the open space  
That borders on the wall; in sacred garb  
Follows the lesser crowd: the Vestals come  
By priestess led with laurel crown bedecked,  
To whom alone is given the right to see  
Minerva's effigy that came from Troy.^[See Book IX., 1177.]  
Next come the keepers of the sacred books  
And fate's predictions; who from Almo's brook  
Bring back Cybebe laved; the augur too  
Taught to observe sinister flight of birds;  
And those who serve the banquets to the gods;  
And Titian brethren; and the priest of Mars,  
Proud of the buckler that adorns his neck;  
By him the Flamen, on his noble head  
The cap of office. While they tread the path  
That winds around the walls, the aged seer  
Collects the thunderbolts that fell from heaven,  
And lays them deep in earth, with muttered words  
Naming the spot accursed. Next a steer,  
Picked for his swelling neck and beauteous form,  
He leads to the altar, and with slanting knife  
Spreads on his brow the meal, and pours the wine.  
The victim's struggles prove the gods averse;  
But when the servers press upon his horns  
He bends the knee and yields him to the blow.  
No crimson torrent issues at the stroke,  
But from the wound a dark empoisoned stream  
Ebbs slowly downward. Aruns at the sight  
Aghast, upon the entrails of the beast  
Essayed to read the anger of the gods.  
Their very colour terrified the seer;  
Spotted they were and pale, with sable streaks  
Of lukewarm gore bespread; the liver damp  
With foul disease, and on the hostile part  
The angry veins defiant; of the lungs  
The fibre hid, and through the vital parts  
The membrane small; the heart has ceased to throb;  
Blood oozes through the ducts; the caul is split:  
And, fatal omen of impending ill,  
One lobe o'ergrows the other; of the twain  
The one lies flat and sick, the other beats  
And keeps the pulse in rapid strokes astir.  
Disaster's near approach thus learned, he cries-  
' Whatever may be the purpose of the gods,  
' Tis not for me to tell; this offered beast  
' Not Jove possesses, but the gods below.  
' We dare not speak our fears, yet fear doth make  
' The future worse than fact. May all the gods  
' Prosper the tokens, and the sacrifice  
' Be void of truth, and Tages (famous seer)^[Tages. A dwarf, with the figure of a child, but with grey hairs, ploughed up by a peasant near Tarquinii. He betrayed the secrets of Etruscan lore and straightway died. (Mommsen, vol. i. p. 190; Dennis, 'Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria,' vol. i. p. 373.)]  
' Have vainly taught these mysteries.' Such his words

### A story by John Conington about Parma from Commentary on Vergil's Aeneid, Volume 2



Heyne thinks this line spurious, and Ribbeck, following the Parma edition, inserts it after v. 641. But it is natural that the Capitol should be represented with the accessories familiar to a Roman, whether they formed a part of the historical scene or not (see two last notes), and Virg. doubtless meant to note Vulcan's art in giving the effect of the "strawbuilt shed" in gold, just as in Il. 18. 548, 9 we are told that the blackness of the ploughed land was represented in gold. Gossrau observes rightly of the commentators, Non animadverterunt non historiam narrari sed describi rem inenarrabilem. "Recens" refers to the freshness and sharpness of Vulcan's work; but it also alludes to the constant renovation of the casa Romuli in the historical times of Rome, attested by Dionys. Ant. 1. 79. Vitruv. 2. 1 and other writers agree with Virg. in placing Romulus' hut on the Capitol: Dionys. l. c. puts it \rendergreek{ἐκ τοῦ Παλαντίου ἐπὶ τῆς πρὸς τὸν ἱππόδρουον στρεφούσης λαγόνος}. For the different ways of reconciling or getting rid of this discrepancy see Lewis pp. 238 foll. His own explanation, that there were two luts, is hardly supported by the parallel he urges of duplicate relics preserved in offerent places, as there rivalry comes in as a motive for multiplying memorials, which cannot have been the case in Rome with its state religion: it is strange too that the fact of the existence of two should not have been mentioned by any ancient writer. "Romuleo" again points to the renovation, which kept the hut as it was in Romulus' days, while at the same time we are meant to think of Romulea or Romuli regia, the hut being all that romulus had for his palace. Lewis' view seems to be supported by H. Jordan, Hermes 7, p. 193 foll.[^273fe03e719a47b6b8344c3243371ced]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Mutina from Philippics



But since it is not only courage but wisdom also which is expected from this order (although these qualities appear scarcely possible to be separated, still let us separate them here), courage bids us fight, inflames our just hatred, urges us to the conflict, summons us to danger. What says wisdom? She uses more cautious counsels, she is provident for the future, she is in every respect more on the defensive. What then does she think? for we must obey her, and we are bound to consider that the best thing which is arranged in the most prudent manner. If she enjoins me to think nothing of more consequence than my life, not to fight at the risk of my life, but to avoid all danger, I will then ask her whether I am also to become a slave when I have obeyed all these injunction? If she says, yes; I for one will not listen to that Wisdom, however learned she may be; but if the answer is, Preserve your life and your safety, Preserve your fortune, "Preserve your estate, still, however, considering all these things of less value than liberty; therefore enjoy these things if you can do so consistently with the freedom of the republic, and do not abandon liberty for them, but sacrifice them for liberty, as proofs of the injury you have sustained;"—then I shall think that I really am listening to the voice of Wisdom, and I will obey her as a god.[^cad35a5eb6144e21aa5cac1d270a0d5d]

### A story by E. T. Merrill about Verona from Commentary on Catullus



This pasquinade, in the form of a conversation between the poet and the door of a certain house, abounds in difficulties of interpretation for us, though its directness of personal reference must have made it clear enough to the Veronese. Its tone of familiarity with, and personal interest in, the tittle-tattle of the city seems to indicate that it was composed before Catullus left Verona to live at Rome, and not during one of his brief visits to his old home. The motive is apparently as follows (see also later notes): The Door is that of a house in Verona (v. 34), formerly owned by an aged (v. 4) bachelor or widower (v. 6) named Balbus, after whose death (v. 6) it came into the possession of his son (v. 1) Caecilius, who thereupon married (v. 6) and brought home a young and lively widow (v. 20) from Brixia (v. 32), who claimed to be also a maid (v. 19). Strange rumors about her life soon began to spread through Verona, and the poet inquires of the Door why it has betrayed its master's confidence (presumably by letting in lovers to corrupt the young wife). The Door defends itself by saying that it has not betrayed its trust, but the woman was a bad lot before she came to Verona, and the current gossip is true of the period of her former marriage; for though her husband was notoriously impotent, his father stepped in to fill the son's place in the household, and the woman moreover was too intimate with certain other people named and hinted at. The proof of this culpability is found not only in rumors that have followed her from Brixia, but in her own familiar talk with her maids in the presence of the Door, which she treated as if it could neither hear nor speak.—The conception of the door as a bar in the way of would-be lovers is familiar enough in ancient poetry (cf. Catul. 63.65 and Plautus, Horace, Ovid, Propertius, etc. passim); Propertius (Prop. 1.16ff.) also represents the door as speaking of its experiences.

The poet speaks: You have been the trusted servant of the newly-made husband (Caecilius), as you were of his father (Balbus); the latter you served faithfully (vv. 3, 4); now that he is dead (v. 6) you know well what he would wish you to do (v. 5 _voto_), but you have wilfully disregarded it (_servisse maligne_), and have entirely changed (v. 7 _mutata_) your character; why have you thus abandoned your former habit of fidelity to your master's interests (v. 8)?

dulci viro: cf. Catul. 66.33 dulci coniuge .

teque: etc. cf. the formal expression in the invocation of Scipio, Liv. 29.27 ea vos omnia bene iuvetis, bonis auctibus auxitis .

bona ope: cf. Catul. 34.23 bona ope .

auctet: the word apparently occurs only here and in Pl. Amph. 6 bono atque amplo auctare lucro , and Lucr. 1.56 unde omnis natura creet res, auctet, alatque .

ipse senex: the aged master, in contrast to his son and heir.

rursus: on the contrary; cf. Catul. 22.11

voto servisse maligne: observe the emphatic contrast to v. 3 _Balbo servisse benigne_.

porrecto: sc. in death; cf. Prop. 2.8.33 viderat informem multa Patroclon harena porrectum .

marita: i.e. you have come into the possession of a married couple (Balbus having been, therefore, a bachelor or a widower); cf. Liv. 27.31.5 vagabatur per maritas domos; and on the other hand such phrases as Catul. 68.6 in lecto caelibe .

agedum: cf. Catul. 63.78.

ita Caecilio placeam: the Door is sincere in its desire to be faithful to the husband, Caecilius, and to be acquitted in his sight, for it evidently views him as sinned against by a designing and criminal wife; cf. 20 ff n.

pote: see Catul. 17.24n.

See Crit. App.

qui … omnes: apparently referring to v. 12 _populi_.

quacumque: sc. _ratione_, modifying _factum_.

non satis: etc., the poet suggests that a categorical denial is not enough, but convincing proof of innocence should be offered.

nos … nobis: referring to the speaker only, as in v.7.

virgo: etc., i. e. to be sure, though a widow, she passed herself off as a maid, and every one knew that she might well be so as far as her husband was concerned.

nobis: the Door unites interests with the injured husband against the guilty wife.

vir prior: carefully to distinguish her weakling husband from Caecilius.

attigerit: subjunctive of concession.

tenera beta: so Augustus is said (Suet. Oct. 87) to have used _betissare_ for _languere_.

sicula: \rendergreek{ἅπαξ λεγόμενον}

illius: elsewhere in Catullus this and similar genitives have the penult short.

conscelerasse domum: cf. Catul. 64.404 divos scelerare parentes , also of unnatural crime.

iners sterili semine: on the repetition of idea in the adjectives cf. Catul. 64.64, Catul. 64.103, Catul. 64.221; Catul. 90.5; and (with Ellis) v. 48.

zonam: etc. cf. Catul. 2.13n.

Brixia: the modern Brescia, the capital of the (Gallic) Cenomani (Liv. 32.30). It is about as far to the westward of Sirmio as Verona is to the eastward (one half-hour by rail). —The remainder of the verse is involved in great difficulty; it might naturally be taken to refer to the situation of Brixia at the base of a hill, but _suppositum_ is apparently not used elsewhere in the sense of 'lying at the foot of,' and no hill in the neighborhood of Brixia is called by a name resembling _chinea_ till about A.D. 1500, when this passage from Catullus might have influenced local nomenclature (cf. the case of the Grampian Hills).

praecurrit Mella: the Mella (cf. Verg. G. 4.278 curva prope flumina Mellae ) flows about a mile to the westward of Brixia.

mater: Brixia is nowhere else called the mother-city of Verona, though some writers speak of Verona as a Gallic town; cf. Ptol. 3.1.27; Just. 20.5.8; not so, perhaps, Livy (Liv. 5.35.1), nor, certainly, Pliny (Plin. NH 3.130).

The two men, evidently inhabitants of Brixia, are otherwise unknown.

37-40. A remark of the Door itself, which, having been fairly started on its story by v. 18, continues it to the end, preferring to anticipate rather than to await criticism.

dixerit aliquis: see Roby (Lat. Gram. vol. 2. Pref.), who thinks the verb in this construction probably indicative.

tigillo: the lintel, not the jamb, as _suffixa_ sufficiently indicates. The ancient door, like some heavier specimens of modern make, swung on two vertical pivots fitting into sockets near the extremity of lintel and sill respectively.

tollat supercilia: sc. in anger; cf. Schol. on Ar. Vesp. 655 τὰς ὀφρῦς αἴρειν ἔθος τοῖς ὀργιζομένοις .

rubra: perhaps not of the color of the brows, as a mark of identification, but of the flush of anger on the forehead: the hints toward identification follow later.

longus: tall; as in Catul. 86.1 longa .

magnas cui: etc. i. e. he had been sued on a charge of bastardy (though the expected birth finally did not take place), and the case had been a noteworthy (_magnas_) one.[^c9825f5c06b648eeac3fc3e05eafe86f]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Mutina from Historiae



Hostilities had ceased everywhere, but a considerable number of the Senate, who had accompanied Otho from Rome, and had been afterwards left at Mutina, encountered the utmost peril. News of the defeat was brought to this place. The soldiers, however, rejected it as a false report; and judging the Senate to be hostile to Otho, watched their language, and put an unfavourable construction on their looks and manner. Proceeding at last to abuse and insults, they sought a pretext for beginning a massacre, while a different anxiety also weighed upon the Senators, who, knowing that the party of Vitellius was in the ascendant, feared that they might seem to have been tardy in welcoming the conqueror. Thus they met in great alarm and distracted by a twofold apprehension; no one was ready with any advice of his own, but looked for safety in sharing any mistake with many others. The anxieties of the terrified assembly were aggravated when the Senate of Mutina made them an offer of arms and money, and, with an ill-timed compliment, styled them "Conscript Fathers."[^3ebed1e545dd4d68a1a6bb689ebf73f7]

And I notice, O conscript fathers, that there are some who favor this proposal: whose intention and design is, as they see that that will be a most glorious day for Decimus Brutus on which we return to our usual dress out of joy for his safety, to deprive him of this great reward, so that it may not be handed down to the recollection of posterity that the Roman people had recourse to the garb of war on account of the danger of one single citizen, and then returned to their gowns of pence on account of his safety. Take away this reason, and you will find no other for so absurd a proposal. But do you, O conscript fathers, preserve your authority, adhere to your own opinions, preserve in your recollection what you have often declared, that the whole result of this entire war depends on the life of one most brave and excellent man.[^817ca213c3264e889e9cdf1796054c55]

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Thus spake the hag  
And through redoubled night, a squalid veil  
Swathing her pallid features, stole among  
Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves,  
The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied  
Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step  
She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh  
As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs  
Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung  
The fates of slain unnumbered; had she striven  
Armies to raise and order back to life  
Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed  
Of Erebus; and, summoned up from Styx,  
Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call,  
And rising fought once more. At length the witch  
Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape  
Fit for her purpose. Gripped by pitiless hook  
O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave  
Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore  
The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink  
The land that girds the precipice of hell  
Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves  
A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew  
Casts shade impenetrable. Foul decay  
Fills all the space, and in the deep recess  
Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells,  
Reigns ever. Not where gape the misty jaws  
Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound  
Of either world, through which the nether kings  
Permit the passage of the dead to earth,  
So poisonous, mephitic, hangs the air.  
Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades  
Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave  
Were not a part of hell. Discordant hues  
Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn;  
Bare was her visage, and upon her brow  
Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks  
In sable coils entwined. But when she saw  
The youth's companions trembling, and himself  
With eyes cast down, with visage as of death,  
Thus spake the witch: ' Forbid your craven souls  
'These fears to cherish: soon returning life  
'This frame shall quicken, and in tones which reach  
Even the timorous ear shall speak the man.  
'If I have power the Stygian lakes to show,  
The bank that sounds with fire, the fury band,  
'And giants fettered, and the hound that shakes  
'Bristling with heads of snakes his triple head,  
What fear is this that cringes at the sight  
Of timid shivering shades? '  
Then to her prayer.  
First through his gaping bosom blood she pours  
Still fervent, washing from his wounds the gore.  
Then copious poisons from the moon distils  
Mixed with all monstrous things which Nature's pangs  
Bring to untimely birth; the froth from dogs  
Stricken with madness, foaming at the stream;  
A lynx's entrails: and the knot that grows  
Upon the fell hyaena; flesh of stags  
Fed upon serpents; and the sucking fish  
Which holds the vessel back^[One of the miraculous stories to be found in Pliny's 'Natural History.' See Lecky's 'Augustus to Charlemagne,' vol. i., p. 370.] though eastern winds  
Make bend the canvas; dragon's eyes; and stones  
That sound beneath the brooding eagle's wings.  
Nor Araby's viper, nor the ocean snake  
Who in the Red Sea waters guards the shell,  
Are wanting; nor the slough on Libyan sands  
By horned reptile cast; nor ashes fail  
Snatched from an altar where the Phoenix died.  
And viler poisons many, which herself  
Has made, she adds, whereto no name is given:  
Pestiferous leaves pregnant with magic chants  
And blades of grass which in their primal growth  
Her cursed mouth had slimed. Last came her voice  
More potent than all herbs to charm the gods  
Who rule in Lethe. Dissonant murmurs first  
And sounds discordant from the tongues of men  
She utters, scarce articulate: the bay  
Of wolves, and barking as of dogs, were mixed  
With that fell chant; the screech of nightly owl  
Raising her hoarse complaint; the howl of beast  
And sibilant hiss of snake-all these were there;  
And more-the wail of waters on the rock,  
The sound of forests and the thunder peal.  
Such was her voice; but soon in clearer tones  
Reaching to Tartarus, she raised her song:  
' Ye awful goddesses, avenging power  
' Of Hell upon the damned, and Chaos huge  
' Who striv'st to mix innumerable worlds,  
' And Pluto, king of earth, whose weary soul  
' Grieves at his godhead; Styx; and plains of bliss  
' We may not enter: and thou, Proserpine,  
' Hating thy mother and the skies above,  
' My patron goddess, last and lowest form^[The mysterious goddess Hecate was identified with Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Proserpine in the lower regions. The text is doubtful.]  
' Of Hecate, through whom the shades and I  
' Hold silent converse; warder of the gate  
' Who castest human offal to the dog:  
' Ye sisters who shall spin the threads again;^[That is, for the second life of her victim.]  
' And thou, O boatman of the burning wave,  
' Now wearied of the shades from hell to me  
' Returning, hear me if with voice I cry  
' Abhorred, polluted; if the flesh of man  
' Hath ne'er been absent from my proffered song,  
Flesh washed with brains still quivering; if the child  
Whose severed head I placed upon the dish  
But for this hand had lived-a listening ear  
Lend to my supplication! From the caves  
'Hid in the innermost recess of hell  
' I claim no soul long banished from the light.  
' For one but now departed, lingering still  
' Upon the brink of Orcus, is my prayer.  
Grant (for ye may) that listening to the spell  
'Once more he seek his dust; and let the shade  
Of this our soldier perished (if the war  
Well at your hands has merited), proclaim  
The destiny of Magnus to his son.'  
Such prayers she uttered; then upraised her head  
And foaming lips, and present saw the ghost.  
Hard by he stood, beside the hated corpse  
His ancient prison, and loathed to enter in.  
There was the yawning chest where fell the blow  
That was his death; and yet the gift supreme  
Of death, his right, (Ah, wretch! ) was reft away.  
Angered at Death the witch, and at the pause  
Conceded by the fates, with living snake  
Scourges the nerveless corse; and on the dead  
She barks through fissures gaping to her song,  
Breaking the silence of their gloomy home:  
' Tisiphone, Megaera, heed ye not?  
Flies not this wretched soul before your whips  
' The void of Erebus? By your very names,  
' She-dogs of hell, I'll call you to the day,  
Not to return; through sepulchres and death  
Your gaoler: from funereal urns and tombs  
I'll chase you forth. And thou, too, Hecate,  
Who to the gods in comely shape and mien,  
Not that of Erebus, appear'st, henceforth  
Wasted and pallid as thou art in hell  
'At my command shalt come. I'll noise abroad  
The banquet that beneath the solid earth  
Holds thee, thou maid of Enna; by what bond  
'Thou lov'st night's King, by what mysterious stain  
Infected, so that Ceres fears from hell  
'To call her daughter. And for thee, base king,  
'Titan shall pierce thy caverns with his rays  
And sudden day shall smite thee. Do ye hear?  
'Or shall I summon to mine aid that god  
'At whose dread name earth trembles; who can look  
Unflinching on the Gorgon's head, and drive  
'The Furies with his scourge, who holds the depths

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Thus spake the hag  
And through redoubled night, a squalid veil  
Swathing her pallid features, stole among  
Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves,  
The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied  
Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step  
She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh  
As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs  
Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung  
The fates of slain unnumbered; had she striven  
Armies to raise and order back to life  
Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed  
Of Erebus; and, summoned up from Styx,  
Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call,  
And rising fought once more. At length the witch  
Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape  
Fit for her purpose. Gripped by pitiless hook  
O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave  
Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore  
The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink  
The land that girds the precipice of hell  
Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Genua from Divus Claudius



He undertook only one expedition, and that was of short duration. The triumphal ornaments decreed him by the senate, he considered as beneath the imperial dignity, and was therefore resolved to have the honour of a real triumph. For this purpose, he selected Britain, which had never been attempted by any one since Julius Caesar,^[Opposed to this statement there is a passage in Servius Georgius, iii. 33, asserting that he had heard (accipimus) that Augustus, besides his victories in the east, triumphed over the Britons in the west; and Horace says:- Augustus adjectis Britannis Imperio gravibusque Persis. Ode iii. 5, 1. Strabo likewise informs us, that in his time, the petty British kings sent embassies to cultivate the alliance of Augustus, and make offerings in the Capitol: and that nearly the whole island was on terms of amity with the Romans, and, as well as the Gauls, paid a light tribute.-Strabo, B. iv. p. 138. That Augustus contemplated a descent on the island, but was prevented from attempting it by his being recalled from Gaul by the disturbances in Dalmatia, is very probable. Horace offers his vows for its success: Serves iturum, Caesarum in ultimos Orbis Britannos. Ode i. 35. But the word _iturus_ shews that the scheme was only projected, and the lines previously quoted are mere poetical flattery. Strabo's statement of the communications kept up with the petty kings of Britain, who were perhaps divided by intestine wars, are, to a certain extent, probably correct, as such a policy would be a prelude to the intended expedition. ] and was then chafing with rage, because the Romans would not give up some deserters. Accordingly, he set sail from Ostia, but was twice very near being wrecked by the boisterous wind called Circius,^[Circius. Aulus Gellius, Seneca, and Pliny, mention under this name the strong southerly gales which prevail in the gulf of Genoa and the neighbouring seas. ] upon the coast of Liguria, near the islands called Stoechades.^[The Stoechades were the islands now called Hieres, off Toulon. ] Having marched by land from Marseilles to Gessoriacum,^[Claudius must have expended more time in his march from Marseilles to Gessoriacum, as Boulogne was then called, than in his vaunted conquest of Britain. ] he thence passed over to Britain, and part of the island submitting to him, within a few days after his arrival, without battle or bloodshed, he returned to Rome in less than six months from the time of his departure, and triumphed in the most solemn manner;^[In point of fact, he was only sixteen days in the island, receiving the submission of some tribes in the south-eastern districts. But the way had been prepared for him by his able general, Aulus Plautius, who defeated Cunobeline, and made himself master of his capital, Camulodunum, or Colchester. These successes were followed up by Ostorius, who conquered Caractacus and sent him to Rome. It is singular that Suetonius has supplied us with no particulars of these events. Some account of them is given in the disquisition appended to this life of Caligula. The expedition of Plautius took place A. U. C. 796, A D. 44. ] to witness which, he not only gave leave to governors of provinces to come to Rome, but even to some of the exiles. Among the spoils taken from the enemy, he fixed upon the pediment of his house in the Palatium, a naval crown, in token of his having passed, and, as it were, conquered the Ocean, and had it suspended near the civic crown which was there before. Messalina, his wife, followed his chariot in a covered litter.^[Carpentum: see note in CALIGULA, c. xv. ] Those who had attained the honour of triumphal ornaments in the same war, rode behind; the rest followed on foot, wearing the robe with the broad stripes. Crassus Frugi was mounted upon a horse richly caparisoned, in a robe embroidered with palm leaves, because this was the second time of his obtaining that honour.

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Ostia/Portus from Against Vatinius



I defended my old friend, who was, nevertheless an acquaintance of yours, though in this city an attack on another, such as you are now making, is sometimes found fault with, but the defence of a man never is.

But I ask you why I should not defend Caius Cornelius? I ask whether Cornelius has ever passed any law in defiance of the _auspices_? whether he has despised the Aelian or the Fufian law? when he has offered violence to the consul? whether he has occupied any temple with armed men? whether he has driven away by violence any magistrate who was exercising his veto? whether he has profaned any religious ceremonies? whether he has drained the treasury? whether he has pillaged the republic? These, all these, are actions of yours. No imputation of this sort is cast upon Cornelius. He was said to have read a document.^[There is some corruption in the text here.] It was urged in his defence, his colleagues giving evidence in support of his cause, that he read it not for the sake of reading it but for the sake of examining it more particularly. However, it was quite certain that Cornelius dismissed the council that day, and submitted to the interposition of the veto. But you who are offended at my defending Cornelius, what cause do you bring to your advocates to uphold, or what countenance have you to show? when you already point out to them in an imperious manner, what a disgrace it will be to them if they defend you by thinking the defence of Cornelius a matter for accusation and abuse of me.[^3ec2c50f63d04bc1acd0746cf092d8a8]

For why should I speak of Publius Gavius, a citizen of the municipality of Cosa, O judges? or with what vigour of language, with what gravity of expression, with what grief of mind shall I mention him? But, indeed, that indignation fails me. I must take more care than usual that what I am going to say be worthy of my subject,—worthy of the indignation which I feel. For the charge is of such a nature, that when I was first informed of it I thought I should not avail myself of it. For although I knew that it was entirely true, still I thought that it would not appear credible. Being compelled by the tears of all the Roman citizens who are living as traders in Sicily, being influenced by the testimonies of the men of Valentia, most honourable men, and by those of all the Rhegians, and of many Roman knights who happened at that time to be at Messana, I produced at the previous pleading only just that amount of evidence which might prevent the matter from appearing doubtful to any one.[^527f520320c54bd69fe226dbf8ad6706]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Ostia/Portus from Divus Claudius



He completed some important public works, which, though, not numerous, were very useful. The principal were an aqueduct, which had been begun by Caius; an emissary for the discharge of the waters of the Fucine lake,^[The Fucine Lake is now called Lago di Celano, in the Farther Abruzzi. It is very extensive, but shallow, so that the difficulty of constructing the Claudian emissary, can scarcely be compared to that encountered in a similar work for lowering the level of the waters in the Alban lake, completed A. U. C. 359. ] and the harbour of Ostia; although he knew that Augustus had refused to comply with the repeated application of the Marsians for one of these; and that the other had been several times intended by Julius Caesar, but as often abandoned on account of the difficulty of its execution. He brought to the city the cool and plentiful springs of the Claudian water, one of which is called Caeruleus. and the other Curtius and Albudinus, as likewise the river of the New Anio, in a stone canal: and distributed them into many magnificent reservoirs. The canal from the Fucine lake was undertaken as much for the sake of profit, as for the honour of the enterprise; for there were parties who offered to drain it at their own expense, on condition of their having a grant of the land laid dry. With great difficulty he completed a canal three miles in length, partly by cutting through, and partly by tunnelling, a mountain; thirty thousand men being constantly employed in the work for eleven years.^[Respecting the Claudian aqueduct, see CALIGULA, c. xxi.] He formed the harbour at Ostia, by carrying out circular piers on the right and on the left, with a mole protecting, in deep water, the entrance of the port.^[Ostia is referred to in a note, TIBERIUS, c. xi.] To secure the foundation of this mole, he sunk the vessel in which the great obelisk^[Suetonius calls this " the great obelisk " in comparison with those which Augustus had placed in the Circus Maximus and Campus Martius. The one here mentioned was erected by Caligula in his Circus, afterwards called the Circus of Nero. It stood at Heliopolis, having been dedicated to the sun, as Herodotus informs us, by Phero, son of Sesostris, in acknowledgment of his recovery from blindness. It was removed by Pope Sixtus V. in 1586, under the celebrated architect, Fontana, to the centre of the area before St. Peter's, in the Vatican, not far from its former position. This obelisk is a solid piece of red granite, without hieroglyphics, and, with the pedestal and ornaments at the top, is 182 feet high. The height of the obelisk itself is 113 palms, or 84 feet.] had been brought from Egypt;^[Pliny relates some curious particulars of this ship:-"A fir tree of prodigious size was used in the vessel which, by the command of Caligula, brought the obelisk from Egypt, which stands in the Vatican Circus, and four blocks of the same sort of stone to support it. Nothing certainly ever appeared on the sea more astonishing than this vessel; 120,000 bushels of lentiles served for its ballast; the length of it nearly equalled all the left side of the port of Ostia; for it was sent there by the emperor Claudius. The thickness of the tree was as much as four men could embrace with their arms."-B. xvi. c. 76. ] and built upon piles a very lofty tower, in imitation of the Pharos at Alexandria, on which lights were burnt to direct mariners in the night.[^fc199763facc48e2b47c82e0964de0fa]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Ostia/Portus from Divus Claudius



He likewise granted the consular ornaments to his Ducenarian procurators. From those who declined the senatorian dignity, he took away the equestrian. Although he had in the beginning of his reign declared, that he would admit no man into the senate who was not the great-grandson of a Roman citizen, yet he gave the "broad hem" to the son of a freedman, on condition that he should be adopted by a Roman knight. Being afraid, however, of incurring censure by such an act, he informed the public, that his ancestor Appius Caecus, the censor, had elected the sons of freedmen into the senate; for he was ignorant, it seems, that in the times of Appius, and a long while afterwards, persons manumitted were not called freedmen, but only their sons who were free-born. Instead of the expense which the college of quaestors was obliged to incur in paving the high-ways, he ordered them to give the people an exhibition of gladiators; and relieving them of the provinces of Ostia and [Cisalpine] Gaul, he reinstated them in the charge of the treasury, which, since it was taken from them, had been managed by the praetors, or those who had formerly filled that office. He gave the triumphal ornaments to Silanus, who was betrothed to his daughter, though he was under age; and in other cases, he bestowed them on so many, and with so little reserve, that there is extant a letter unanimously addressed to him by all the legions, begging him "to grant his consular lieutenants the triumphal ornaments at the time of their appointment to commands, in order to prevent their seeking occasion to engage in unnecessary wars."

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Cosa from Against Verres



Now since it is made clear beyond a doubt to every one, in what state your case is, and what will become of you, I will deal thus with you: I will prove that that Gavius whom you all of a sudden assert to have been a spy, had been confined by you in the stone-quarries at Syracuse; and I will prove that, not only by the registers of the Syracusans,—lest you should be able to say that, because there is a man named Gavius mentioned in those documents, I have invented this charge, and picked out this name so as to be able to say that this is the man,—but in accordance with your own choice I will produce witnesses, who will state that that identical man was thrown by you into the stone-quarries at Syracuse. I will produce, also, citizens of Cosa, his fellow citizens and relations,, who shall teach you, though it is too late, and who shall also teach the judges, (for it is not too late for them to know them,) that that Publius Gavius whom you crucified was a Roman citizen, and a citizen of the municipality of Cosa, not a spy of runaway slaves.[^02114313af3345679348d69ef2b6ea22]

By this reckoning, then, the seaboard of Egypt will be four hundred and fifty miles in length. Inland from the sea as far as Heliopolis, Egypt is a wide land, all flat and watery and marshy. From the sea up to Heliopolis is a journey about as long as the way from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to the temple of Olympian Zeus at Pisa. If a reckoning is made, only a little difference of length, not more than two miles, will be found between these two journeys; for the journey from Athens to Pisa is two miles short of two hundred, which is the number of miles between the sea and Heliopolis.[^f8b9b96275d54e4c9d0bb91bd1399544]

### A story by Virgil about Luna from Georgics



If wool delight thee, first, be far removed  
All prickly boskage, burrs and caltrops; shun  
Luxuriant pastures; at the outset choose  
White flocks with downy fleeces. For the ram,  
How white soe'er himself, be but the tongue  
'Neath his moist palate black, reject him, lest  
He sully with dark spots his offspring's fleece,  
And seek some other o'er the teeming plain.  
Even with such snowy bribe of wool, if ear  
May trust the tale, Pan, God of Arcady,  
Snared and beguiled thee, Luna, calling thee  
To the deep woods; nor thou didst spurn his call.

### A story by Polybius about Parma from Histories



While Hannibal was thus engaged in effecting a passage over the Pyrenees, where he was greatly alarmed at the extraordinary strength of the positions occupied by the Celts; the Romans, having heard the result of the embassy to Carthage, and that Hannibal had crossed the Iber earlier than they expected, at the head of an army, voted to send Publius Cornelius Scipio with his legions into Iberia, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus into Libya. And while the Consuls were engaged in hastening on the enrolment of their legions and other military preparations, the people were active in bringing to completion the colonies which they had already voted to send into Gaul. They accordingly caused the fortification of these towns to be energetically pushed on, and ordered the colonists to be in residence within thirty days: six thousand having been assigned to each colony.^[ Placentia and Cremona.] One of these colonies was on the south bank of the Padus, and was called Placentia; the other on the north bank, called Cremona. But no sooner had these colonies been formed, than the Boian Gauls, who had long been lying in wait to throw off their loyalty to Rome, but had up to that time lacked an opportunity, encouraged by the news that reached them of Hannibal's approach, revolted; thus abandoning the hostages which they had given at the end of the war described in my last book. The ill-feeling still remaining towards Rome enabled them to induce the Insubres to join in the revolt; and the united tribes swept over the territory recently allotted by the Romans, and following close upon the track of the flying colonists, laid siege to the Roman colony of Mutina, in which the fugitives had taken refuge. Among them were the _triumviri_ or three commissioners who had been sent out to allot the lands; of whom one—Gaius Lutatius—was an ex-consul, the other two ex-praetors.^[ Outrage by Boii and Insubres. ] These men having demanded a parley with the enemy, the Boii consented: but treacherously seized them upon their leaving the town, hoping by their means to recover their own hostages. The praetor Lucius Manlius was on guard in the district with an army; and as soon as he heard what had happened, he advanced with all speed to the relief of Mutina. But the Boii, having got intelligence of his approach, prepared an ambuscade; and as soon as his army had entered a certain wood, they rushed out upon it from every side and killed a large number of his men. The survivors at first fled with precipitation: but having gained some higher ground, they rallied sufficiently to enable them with much difficulty to effect an honourable retreat. Even so, the Boii followed close upon their heels, and besieged them in a place called the village of Tannes.^[Livy, 21, 25, calls it _Tannetum,_ and describes it only as _vicus Pado propinquus._ It was a few miles from Parma.] When the news arrived at Rome, that the fourth legion was surrounded and closely besieged by the Boii, the people in all haste despatched the legions which had been voted to the Consul Publius, to their relief, under the command of a Praetor; and ordered the Consul to enrol two more legions for himself from the allies.[^3e497191681840e5a73dff960a35f2b9]

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Soon as the sun dispelled the chilly night,  
The sounding doors flew wide, and from the tomb  
Of dead Hortensius grieving Marcia came.^[Marcia was first married to Cato, and bore him three sons; he then yielded her to Hortensius. On his death she returned to Cato. (Plutarch, 'Cato,' 25, 52.) It was in reference to this that Caesar charged him with making a traffic of his marriage; but Plutarch says 'to accuse Cato of filthy lucre is like upbraiding Hercules with cowardice.' After the marriage Marcia remained at Rome while Cato hurried after Pompeius.]  
First joined in wedlock to a greater man  
Three children did she bear to grace his home:  
Then Cato to Hortensius gave the dame  
To be a fruitful mother of his sons  
And join their houses in a closer tie.  
And now the last sad offices were done  
She came with hair dishevelled, beaten breast,  
And ashes on her brow, and features worn  
With grief; thus only pleasing to the man.  
' When youth was in me and maternal power  
' I did thy bidding, Cato, and received  
' A second husband: now in years grown old  
' Ne'er to be parted I return to thee.  
' Renew our former pledges undefiled:  
' Give back the name of wife: upon my tomb  
' Let " Marcia, spouse to Cato," be engraved.  
' Nor let men question in the time to come,  
' Didst thou compel, or did I willing leave  
' My first espousals. Not in happy times,  
' Partner of joys, I come; but days of care  
' And labour shall be mine to share with thee.  
' Nor leave me here, but take me to the camp,  
' Thy fond companion: why should Magnus' wife  
' Be nearer, Cato, to the wars than thine?'  
Although the times were warlike and the fates  
Called to the fray, he lent a willing ear.  
Yet must they plight their faith in simple form  
Of law; their witnesses the gods alone.  
No festal wreath of flowers crowned the gate  
Nor glittering fillet on each post entwined;  
No flaming torch was there, nor ivory steps,  
No couch with robes of broidered gold adorned;  
No comely matron placed upon her brow  
The bridal garland, or forbad the foot^[The bride was carried over the threshold of her new home, for to stumble on it would be of evil omen. Plutarch ('Romulus') refers this custom to the rape of the Sabine women, who were 'so lift up and carried away by force.' (North, volume i., p. 88, Edition by Windham.) I have read vetuit in this passage, though vitat appears to be a better variation according to the manuscripts.]  
To touch the threshold stone; no saffron veil  
Concealed the timid blushes of the bride;  
No jewelled belt confined her flowing robe^[The bride was dressed in a long white robe, bound round the waist with a girdle. She had a veil of bright yellow colour. ('Dict. Antiq.')]  
Nor modest circle bound her neck; no scarf  
Hung lightly on the snowy shoulder's edge  
Around the naked arm. Just as she came,  
Wearing the garb of sorrow, while the wool  
Covered the purple border of her robe,  
Thus was she wedded. As she greets her sons  
She greets her husband. Nor, in Sabine use  
Did mournful Cato share the festal taunt:  
Nor friend nor foe was bidden : silent both  
They joined in marriage, yet content, unseen  
By any save by Brutus. Sad and stern  
On Cato's lineaments the marks of grief  
Were still unsoftened, and the hoary hair  
Hung o'er his reverend visage; for since first  
Men flew to arms, his locks were left unkempt  
To stream upon his brow, and on his chin  
His beard untended grew. 'Twas his alone  
Who hated not, nor loved, for all mankind  
To mourn alike. Nor did their former couch  
Again receive them, for his lofty soul  
E'en lawful love resisted. 'Twas his rule^['I know not three wiser precepts for the conduct either of princes or private men.' Sir W. Temple, i. 184, quoting this passage.]  
Inflexible, to keep the middle path  
Marked out and bounded; to observe the laws  
Of natural right; and for his country's sake  
To risk his life, his all, as not for self  
Brought into being, but for all the world:  
Such was his creed. To him a sumptuous feast  
Was hunger conquered, and the lowly hut,  
Which scarce kept out the winter, was a home  
Equal to palaces: a robe of price  
Such hairy garments as were worn of old:  
The end of marriage, offspring. To the State  
Father alike and husband, right and law  
He ever followed with unswerving step:  
No thought of selfish pleasure turned the scale  
In Cato's acts, or swayed his upright soul.  
Meanwhile Pompeius led his trembling host  
To fields Campanian, and held the walls  
First founded by the chief of Trojan race.  
These chose he for the central seat of war,  
Some troops despatching who might meet the foe  
Where shady Apennine lifts up the ridge  
Of mid Italia; nearest to the sky  
Upsoaring, with the seas on either hand,  
The upper and the lower. Pisa's sands  
Breaking the margin of the Tuscan deep,  
Here bound his mountains: there Ancona's towers  
Laved by Dalmatian waves. Rivers immense,  
In his recesses born, pass on their course,  
To either sea diverging. To the left  
Metaurus and Crustumium's torrent fall  
And Sena's streams and Aufidus who bursts  
On Adrian billows; and that mighty flood  
Which, more than all the rivers of the earth,  
Sweeps down the soil and tears the woods away  
And drains Hesperia's springs. In fabled lore  
His banks were first by poplar shade enclosed:^[Phaethon's sisters, who yoked the horses of the Sun to the chariot for their brother, were turned into poplars. Phaethon was flung by Jupiter into the river Po.]  
And when by Phaethon the waning day  
Was drawn in path transverse, and all the heaven  
Blazed with his car aflame, and from the depths  
Of inmost earth were rapt all other floods,  
Padus still rolled in pride of stream along.  
Nile were no larger, but that o'er the sand  
Of level Egypt he spreads out his waves;  
Nor Ister, if he sought the Scythian main  
Unhelped upon his journey through the world  
By tributary waters not his own.  
But on the right hand Tiber has his source,  
Deep-flowing Rutuba, Vulturnus swift,  
And Sarnus breathing vapours of the night^[Sarnus, site of the battle in which Narses defeated Teias, the last of the Ostrogoths, in 553 A.D.]  
Rise there, and Liris with Vestinian wave  
Still gliding through Marica's shady grove,  
And Siler flowing through Salernian meads:  
And Macra's swift unnavigable stream  
Near Luna rests in Ocean. On the Alps  
Whose spurs strike plainwards, and on fields of Gaul  
The cloudy heights of Apennine look down  
In further distance: on his nearer slopes  
The Sabine turns the ploughshare; Umbrian kine  
And Marsian fatten; with his pineclad rocks  
He girds the tribes of Latium, nor leaves  
Hesperia's soil until the waves that beat  
On Scylla's cave compel. His southern spurs  
Extend to Juno's temple, and of old  
Stretched further than Italia, till the main  
O'erstepped his limits and the lands repelled.  
But, when the seas were joined, Pelorus claimed  
His latest summits for Sicilia's isle.

### A story by Pausanias, fl. ca. 150-175 about Pisae from Description of Greece



Many are the sights to be seen in Greece, and many are the wonders to be heard; but on nothing does Heaven bestow more care than on the Eleusinian rites and the Olympic games.The sacred grove of Zeus has been called from of old Altis, a corruption of the word "alsos," which means a grove. Pindar^[Pind. O. 10.55] too calls the place Altis in an ode composed for an Olympic victor.

The temple and the image were made for Zeus from spoils, when Pisa was crushed in war by the Eleans^[circa 570 B.C.], and with Pisa such of the subject peoples as conspired together with her. The image itself was wrought by Pheidias, as is testified by an inscription written under the feet of Zeus:Pheidias, son of Charmides, an Athenian, made me.The temple is in the Doric style, and the outside has columns all around it. It is built of native stone.

Its height up to the pediment is sixty-eight feet, its breadth is ninety-five, its length two hundred and thirty. The architect was Libon, a native. The tiles are not of baked earth, but of Pentelic marble cut into the shape of tiles. The invention is said to be that of Byzes of Naxos, who they say made the images in Naxos on which is the inscription:—To the offspring of Leto was I dedicated by Euergus,A Naxian, son of Byzes, who first made tiles of stone.This Byzes lived about the time of Alyattes the Lydian^[609-560 B.C.], when Astyages, the son of Cyaxares, reigned over the Medes.

At Olympia a gilt caldron stands on each end of the roof, and a Victory, also gilt, is set in about the middle of the pediment. Under the image of Victory has been dedicated a golden shield, with Medusa the Gorgon in relief. The inscription on the shield declares who dedicated it and the reason why they did so. It runs thus:—The temple has a golden shield; from TanagraThe Lacedaemonians and their allies dedicated it,A gift taken from the Argives, Athenians and Ionians,The tithe offered for victory in war.This battle I also mentioned in my history of Attica,^[See Paus. 1.29.] Then I described the tombs that are at Athens.

On the outside of the frieze that runs round the temple at Olympia, above the columns, are gilt shields one and twenty in number, an offering made by the Roman general Mummius when he had conquered the Achaeans in war, captured Corinth, and driven out its Dorian inhabitants.

To come to the pediments: in the front pediment there is, not yet begun, the chariot-race between Pelops and Oenomaus, and preparation for the actual race is being made by both. An image of Zeus has been carved in about the middle of the pediment; on the right of Zeus is Oenomaus with a helmet on his head, and by him Sterope his wife, who was one of the daughters of Atlas. Myrtilus too, the charioteer of Oenomaus, sits in front of the horses, which are four in number. After him are two men. They have no names, but they too must be under orders from Oenomaus to attend to the horses.

At the very edge lies Cladeus, the river which, in other ways also, the Eleans honor most after the Alpheius. On the left from Zeus are Pelops, Hippodameia, the charioteer of Pelops, horses, and two men, who are apparently grooms of Pelops. Then the pediment narrows again, and in this part of it is represented the Alpheius. The name of the charioteer of Pelops is, according to the account of the Troezenians, Sphaerus, but the guide at Olympia called him Cillas.

The sculptures in the front pediment are by Paeonius, who came from Mende in Thrace^[circa 430 B.C.]; those in the back pediment are by Alcamenes,^[There are good reasons, chronological and artistic, for thinking that neither Paeonius not Alcamenes carved the figures on the pediments.] a contemporary of Pheidias, ranking next after him for skill as a sculptor. What he carved on the pediment is the fight between the Lapithae and the Centaurs at the marriage of Peirithous. In the center of the pediment is Peirithous.^[This is supposed to be a mistake.] On one side of him is Eurytion, who has seized the wife of Peirithous, with Caeneus bringing help to Peirithous, and on the other side is Theseus defending himself against the Centaurs with an axe. One Centaur has seized a maid, another a boy in the prime of youth. Alcamenes, I think, carved this scene, because he had learned from Homer's^[Hom. Il. 14.318] poem that Peirithous was a son of Zeus, and because he knew that Theseus was a great grandson of Pelops.

Most of the labours of Heracles are represented at Olympia. Above the doors of the temple is carved the hunting of the Arcadian boar, his exploit against Diomedes the Thracian, and that against Geryones at Erytheia; he is also about to receive the burden of Atlas, and he cleanses the land from dung for the Eleans. Above the doors of the rear chamber he is taking the girdle from the Amazon; and there are the affairs of the deer, of the bull at Cnossus, of the Stymphalian birds, of the hydra, and of the Argive lion.

As you enter the bronze doors you see on the right, before the pillar, Iphitus being crowned by a woman, Ececheiria (Truce), as the elegiac couplet on the statue says. Within the temple stand pillars, and inside also are porticoes above, with an approach through them to the image. There has also been constructed a winding ascent to the roof.[^62f6ca144e8e4d0ab44328c65682697b]

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Thus spake the hag  
And through redoubled night, a squalid veil  
Swathing her pallid features, stole among  
Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves,  
The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied  
Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step  
She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh  
As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs  
Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung  
The fates of slain unnumbered; had she striven  
Armies to raise and order back to life  
Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed  
Of Erebus; and, summoned up from Styx,  
Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call,  
And rising fought once more. At length the witch  
Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape  
Fit for her purpose. Gripped by pitiless hook  
O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave  
Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore  
The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink  
The land that girds the precipice of hell  
Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves  
A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew  
Casts shade impenetrable. Foul decay  
Fills all the space, and in the deep recess  
Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells,  
Reigns ever. Not where gape the misty jaws  
Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound  
Of either world, through which the nether kings  
Permit the passage of the dead to earth,  
So poisonous, mephitic, hangs the air.  
Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades  
Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave  
Were not a part of hell. Discordant hues  
Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn;  
Bare was her visage, and upon her brow  
Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks  
In sable coils entwined. But when she saw  
The youth's companions trembling, and himself  
With eyes cast down, with visage as of death,  
Thus spake the witch: ' Forbid your craven souls  
'These fears to cherish: soon returning life  
'This frame shall quicken, and in tones which reach  
Even the timorous ear shall speak the man.  
'If I have power the Stygian lakes to show,  
The bank that sounds with fire, the fury band,  
'And giants fettered, and the hound that shakes  
'Bristling with heads of snakes his triple head,  
What fear is this that cringes at the sight  
Of timid shivering shades? '  
Then to her prayer.  
First through his gaping bosom blood she pours  
Still fervent, washing from his wounds the gore.  
Then copious poisons from the moon distils  
Mixed with all monstrous things which Nature's pangs  
Bring to untimely birth; the froth from dogs  
Stricken with madness, foaming at the stream;  
A lynx's entrails: and the knot that grows  
Upon the fell hyaena; flesh of stags  
Fed upon serpents; and the sucking fish  
Which holds the vessel back^[One of the miraculous stories to be found in Pliny's 'Natural History.' See Lecky's 'Augustus to Charlemagne,' vol. i., p. 370.] though eastern winds  
Make bend the canvas; dragon's eyes; and stones  
That sound beneath the brooding eagle's wings.  
Nor Araby's viper, nor the ocean snake  
Who in the Red Sea waters guards the shell,  
Are wanting; nor the slough on Libyan sands  
By horned reptile cast; nor ashes fail  
Snatched from an altar where the Phoenix died.  
And viler poisons many, which herself  
Has made, she adds, whereto no name is given:  
Pestiferous leaves pregnant with magic chants  
And blades of grass which in their primal growth  
Her cursed mouth had slimed. Last came her voice  
More potent than all herbs to charm the gods  
Who rule in Lethe. Dissonant murmurs first  
And sounds discordant from the tongues of men  
She utters, scarce articulate: the bay  
Of wolves, and barking as of dogs, were mixed  
With that fell chant; the screech of nightly owl  
Raising her hoarse complaint; the howl of beast  
And sibilant hiss of snake-all these were there;  
And more-the wail of waters on the rock,  
The sound of forests and the thunder peal.  
Such was her voice; but soon in clearer tones  
Reaching to Tartarus, she raised her song:  
' Ye awful goddesses, avenging power  
' Of Hell upon the damned, and Chaos huge  
' Who striv'st to mix innumerable worlds,  
' And Pluto, king of earth, whose weary soul  
' Grieves at his godhead; Styx; and plains of bliss  
' We may not enter: and thou, Proserpine,  
' Hating thy mother and the skies above,  
' My patron goddess, last and lowest form^[The mysterious goddess Hecate was identified with Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Proserpine in the lower regions. The text is doubtful.]  
' Of Hecate, through whom the shades and I  
' Hold silent converse; warder of the gate  
' Who castest human offal to the dog:  
' Ye sisters who shall spin the threads again;^[That is, for the second life of her victim.]  
' And thou, O boatman of the burning wave,  
' Now wearied of the shades from hell to me  
' Returning, hear me if with voice I cry  
' Abhorred, polluted; if the flesh of man  
' Hath ne'er been absent from my proffered song,  
Flesh washed with brains still quivering; if the child  
Whose severed head I placed upon the dish  
But for this hand had lived-a listening ear  
Lend to my supplication! From the caves  
'Hid in the innermost recess of hell  
' I claim no soul long banished from the light.  
' For one but now departed, lingering still  
' Upon the brink of Orcus, is my prayer.  
Grant (for ye may) that listening to the spell  
'Once more he seek his dust; and let the shade  
Of this our soldier perished (if the war  
Well at your hands has merited), proclaim  
The destiny of Magnus to his son.'  
Such prayers she uttered; then upraised her head  
And foaming lips, and present saw the ghost.  
Hard by he stood, beside the hated corpse  
His ancient prison, and loathed to enter in.  
There was the yawning chest where fell the blow  
That was his death; and yet the gift supreme  
Of death, his right, (Ah, wretch! ) was reft away.  
Angered at Death the witch, and at the pause  
Conceded by the fates, with living snake  
Scourges the nerveless corse; and on the dead  
She barks through fissures gaping to her song,  
Breaking the silence of their gloomy home:  
' Tisiphone, Megaera, heed ye not?  
Flies not this wretched soul before your whips  
' The void of Erebus? By your very names,  
' She-dogs of hell, I'll call you to the day,  
Not to return; through sepulchres and death  
Your gaoler: from funereal urns and tombs  
I'll chase you forth. And thou, too, Hecate,  
Who to the gods in comely shape and mien,  
Not that of Erebus, appear'st, henceforth  
Wasted and pallid as thou art in hell  
'At my command shalt come. I'll noise abroad  
The banquet that beneath the solid earth  
Holds thee, thou maid of Enna; by what bond  
'Thou lov'st night's King, by what mysterious stain  
Infected, so that Ceres fears from hell  
'To call her daughter. And for thee, base king,  
'Titan shall pierce thy caverns with his rays  
And sudden day shall smite thee. Do ye hear?  
'Or shall I summon to mine aid that god  
'At whose dread name earth trembles; who can look  
Unflinching on the Gorgon's head, and drive  
'The Furies with his scourge, who holds the depths  
' Ye cannot fathom, and above whose haunts  
Ye dwell supernal; who by waves of Styx  
Forswears himself unpunished? '

### A story by E. T. Merrill about Luca from Commentary on Catullus



A sharp attack upon Julius Caesar for his patronage of Mamurra, with a snap at the end of the lash for Pompey, whose conduct of affairs in the city was alienating the optimates; cf. Intr. 38. The poem was written after the first invasion of Britain (cf. vv. 4, 12, 20), which took place in 55 B.C., and during the lifetime of Julia, Caesar's daughter and Pompey's wife (v. 24), whose death, in the fall of the year 54, weakened the bond between the two leaders.—Meter, pure iambic trimeter (but see note on v. 3).

The writer has before his mind the characteristics he believes Caesar to possess, as v. 10 indicates: but cf. Catul. 16.1n.

quis potest pati: cf. Catul. 42.5 si pati potestis.

Mamurram: perhaps with the first syllable long, as in Catul. 57.2;Hor. S. 1.5.37; Mart. 9.59.1; Mart. 10.4.11; and in several derivatives from the same stem; though this would then be the only irrational foot in this poem, if vv. 20 and 23 be emended so as to introduce none but iambic feet. On the person see Intr. 73f.

quod: etc. i.e. Mamurra has already absorbed and squandered all the proceeds of former conquests of Caesar (cf. vv. 18 and 19), and now shall the present conquests go the same road?

comata Gallia: i.e. _Gallia transalpina,_ so called from the barbarian custom there prevailing of men wearing long hair; cf. Diod. 5.28; Cic. Phil. 8.9.27 Galliam togatam remitto, comatam postulo ; Plin. NH 4.105 Gallia omnis comata uno nomine appellata Suet. Iul. 22 initio quidem Galliam cisalpinam … accepit … mox … comatam quoque.

ultima Britannia: cf. v.12; Catul. 11.11n. Caesar took command in Gaul in 58 B.C., and the first entry into Britain was made in the summer of 55 (cf. Caes. BG 4.20ff.). On the lengthening of the final syllable before initial br, see Intr. 86g.

cinaede: here probably used simply as a word of general abuse (cf. Intr. 32), though Catullus may have in mind such reports about Caesar as those set down by Suetonius in Suet. Iul. 49.

Romule: Caesar is apparently so termed because of his posing as the chief man of the state _domi et militiae._

et ille: etc. i.e. shall he come back to Italy newly enriched from the conquests in Gaul and Britain, and carry on more insolently than ever his life of debauchery?

superbus et superfluens: both adjectives refer to his wealth.

perambulabit: the word is selected to suit the comparison in _columbus_ (v. 8).

columbus: etc. i.e. a favorite of Aphrodite, and so an irresistible suitor. Doves were sacred to the goddess, and drew her chariot, and Adoneus is but another form for Adonis; cf. Pl. Men. 144 ubi Venus [raperet] Adoneum ; Aus. Ep. 30.6 Arabica gens [me existimant] Adoneum.

The appeal is repeated from v. 5, because in vv. 3f. the reference was only to the ill-gotten wealth of Mamurra, while in vv. 6ff. it was to the expected revival of his licentious career.

The verse embodies the stinging conclusion following upon the major premise implied in vv. 1-4, with 6-8, and the minor in vv. 5 and 9.

impudicus: has a technical reference to _cinaede_.

vorax: doubtless refers to gluttony and wine-bibbing, and is not used in the sense of Catul. 33.4 and Catul. 57.8, nor in that of Catul. 80.6 and Catul. 88.8; yet Suetonius (Suet. Iul. 53) reports that Caesar was abstemious in regard to food and drink.

aleo: gambling had grown to be such a passion among the young Romans that it was deemed a serious vice and restrained by law; cf. Cic. Phil. 13.11.24 in lustris, popinis, alea, vino tempus aetatis omne consumpsisses ; Cic. Catil. 2.10.23 in his gregibus omnes aleatores, omnes adulteri, omnes impuri impudicique versantur.

eo nomine: on this account, one of the most frequent of the phrases borrowed from book-keeping. The demonstrative refers onward to the _ut_-clause in v. 13.

imperator unice: in ironical praise; repeated in Catul. 54.7.

ultima: etc. cf. v. 4 n.—Wildest rumors had long been afloat about the vast wealth to be found in the interior of Britain, and many young Roman spendthrifts had desired to join Caesar's expedition there. He actually secured nothing of value, but evidently the true news had not yet spread through Italy.

ista vestra mentula: of a debauchee, as Catul. 17.21 iste meus stupor , of a dull fellow. Mamurra is of course the man referred to (cf. Catul. 94.1ff., Catul. 105.1ff., Catul. 114.1ff., Catul. 115.1ff., and Intr. 73). The possessive points to Pompey as sharing blame with Caesar in the matter; cf. also vv. 21-24.

ducenties aut trecenties: Sc. _centena milia sestertium,_ as regularly with numeral adverbs in the expression of sums of money. _Ducenti_ as well as _trecenti_ (on which cf. Catul. 9.2n.) is used of indefinitely large number; cf. Catul. 37.7; Hor. S. 1.10.60 amet scripsisse ducentos ante cibum versus.

comesset: cf. the same figure for squandering in v. 22 _devorare_.

alid: for aliud, as Catul. 66.28 alis for _alius_; so Plautus, Lucretius, and others. cf. Catul. 34.8n.

sinistra liberalitas: since the giving was made possible by robbery (cf. Catul. 12.1n.); see Cato's strictures (on Caesar?) in Sall. Cat. 52.11ff. quia bona aliena largiri liberalitas … vocatur, etc. The question in this verse touches upon the fitness of giving such gifts; that in the next verse upon Mamurra's fitness to receive them.

cf. Catul. 41.4; Catul. 43.5..

praeda Pontica: probably not that brought back by Pompey in 62 B.C. from the conquest of Mithradates, but that from the capture of Mitylene in 79 B.C., when Caesar was an officer in the army of the governor of Pontus and Bithynia. Thus early was the patrimony of Mamurra already squandered, and thus early, when gains were but small, did Caesar begin to lavish wealth upon him.

Hibera: sc. _praeda_; when Caesar, in 61-60 B.C., governed Further Spain as propraetor.

scit: is witness to; cf. Verg. A. 11.258 scelerum poenas expendimus omnes; … scit triste Minervae sidus ; Ov. Met. 12.439 ast ego … scit tuus hoc genitor—gladium spoliantis in ima ilia demisi.

aurifer Tagus: the Tagus had a reputation like that of the Pactolus; cf. Ov. Am. 1.15.34 auriferi ripa a benigna Tagi ; Mart. 10.16.4 aurea divitis unda Tagi ; Mart. 10.96.3 auriferum Tagum.

nunc: carrying on the series of _prima … secunda … inde tertia_; reports have just arrived of the completed conquest of Gaul and of the invasion of Britain, and the same fate now threatens them that befell former conquests, —to be devoured by Mamurra.

Galliae timetur et Britanniae: sc. _ab incolis_; cf. Sen. Med. 893 iam domus tota occidit, urbi timetur.

hunc malum: this rascal; cf. Catul. 64.175 malus hic ; Pl. Merc. 974 ut dissimulat malus ; Hor. S. 1.4.3 siquis erat dignus describi, quod malus ac fur.

fovetis: sc. Caesar and Pompey.

quid hic potest nisi: etc. what is he good for except, etc.; i.e. it cannot be that you favor him because of his efficient services [Mamurra was _praefectus fabrum_ under Caesar], for he is utterly useless except to swallow up money.

uncta: cf. Catul. 10.11n.

devorare: cf. v. 14 _comesset_; Cic. Phil 2.27.67 non modo unius patrimonium sed urbes et regna devorare potuisset ; Vulg. Marc. 12.40 qui devorant ( Matt. 23.14 qui comeditis) domos viduarum.

patrimonia: of the wealth that replaced the _paterna bona_ (v. 17) first squandered.

eone nomine: etc. i.e. was it for the sake of Mamurra's pockets that this last deal for the final ruin of Rome was made and cemented by a marriage? With this final appeal cf. Catul. 9.10n.

urbis: etc. see Crit. App.

socer generque: perhaps with a sneer at the political interests that dictated the marriage of Caesar's daughter to a man over twenty years her senior, who had lately divorced his wife on suspicion of adultery with Caesar himself. Yet the marriage had actually proved a very happy one on both sides.

perdidistis omnia: the familiar cry of the _optimates_ at this time, when they had become more estranged from their former idol, Pompey, by events following upon the famous council of the so-called triumvirs at Luca in 56 B.C., in accordance with which Pompey and Crassus were this year consuls, with the government of Spain and Syria respectively to follow, while Caesar had just had his command in Gaul extended for five years.[^36602adfd8484713b8c7d5b288940ec8]

### A story by E. T. Merrill about Luca from Commentary on Catullus



37\. But even Sirmio could not long detain him from his loved Rome. His reappearance among his old friends is marked by a single poem (c. 10), whose gay and charming humor shows that even the vicinity of Lesbia had lost its power constantly to embitter his thoughts. And to the passion for Lesbia now appears to have succeeded that for a boy, Juventius, with the charms of whose company Catullus perhaps attempted to drive out the thoughts of his former love. How the intimacy began we cannot tell. The Juventian _gens_ sprang from Tusculum, but inscriptions (C. I. L. vol. V. passim) show that people of that name also lived in the neighborhood of Verona. It may be, therefore, that the boy came to Rome under the guardianship of Catullus, as perhaps Catullus, years before, under that of Nepos But nothing further is known of him beyond what may be inferred from the poems of Catullus that concern him (cf. introductory note to c. 15). His history is interwoven with that of a pair of friends, Aurelius and Furius, both at first friends of Catullus, to the former of whom the poet at one time was led to entrust temporarily the care of his ward (c. 15). The result might have been anticipated. Juventius learned to prefer them to Catullus, and in consequence Catullus vented his wrath upon them in a group of bitter poems (cc. 16, 21, 23, 26), though for Juventius he had only sorrowful remonstrance (cc. 24, 81).

38\. Yet all this experience appears to have touched him in no wise deeply. It was but a passing diversion, and his jealousy not the bitter passion felt against his rivals with Lesbia. With far more earnestness did he throw himself into the political quarrel of his time. The year of his return from Bithynia (56 B.C.) had witnessed the so-called renewal of the triumvirate at Luca, and Caesar appeared to have won everything. In accordance with the agreement made at the Luca conference, Pompey and Crassus were consuls a second time for the year 55, and the senatorial party was at its wits' end. Catullus was apparently not an active political worker, but he did not hesitate to join his political friends in personal attacks upon the foe. Perhaps his earlier shafts were those aimed against Mamurra (cf. § 73), Caesar's notorious favorite (cc. 29, 41, 43, 57), whom Catullus sometimes celebrates under the nickname of Mentula (cc. 94, 105, 114, 115), and these opened the way for the direct attack upon Caesar himself (cc. 54, 93). But whatever the order of attack, that Caesar was piqued by it we know from Suetonius (Iul. 73). That he made a successful effort to win over Catullus, as he did Calvus, we are also assured from the same source. Caesar understood better than most Romans that political power in that city and that day must rest largely upon personal popularity, and he was not above exerting himself to win the good will of individuals of high or low degree. And aside from the fascination due to his great political and military success, he had personal traits that gave him a power over young men. It was the mysterious influence of a natural leader of men; and in many more than these two instances the number of his friends was recruited from the ranks of the younger of his fiercest foes. There was another element also that must have tended to promote the reconciliation between Caesar and Catullus. The father of Catullus was resident at Verona within the limits of Caesar's Cisalpine province. He may not have taken an active part in politics, but at any rate he was a personal friend of Caesar, and often his host (Suet. l.c.). This intimacy may well have led him to see clearly what the result of the approaching struggle for supremacy in Rome was likely to be, and to desire the more eagerly to see his son arrayed for Caesar and not against him.

39\. At all events, the reconciliation was brought about, and the lively pen of Catullus ceased to lampoon the great commander. Some have thought, however, that Mamurra was not included in the peace, and that the utmost Caesar could effect in his favorite's behalf was that his personality should be thereafter thinly veiled under the pseudonym Mentula.

40\. But Caesar was not to profit greatly from his new ally. Up to the end of the year 55 B.C. Catullus displays only hostility to Caesar and the Caesarians. The reconciliation apparently took place at the house of the father of Catullus at Verona during the winter visit of the governor to the nearer province in the early part of the year 54 (Caes. B. G. 5.1). The only poem that shows the change of feeling toward Caesar is c. 11, and this is connected with another marked incident in the life of the poet.

41\. Catullus was now the friend of Caesar. The great commander was entertained at his father's house, and perhaps even there was making his plans for future campaigns. The fortunes of the poet were rising. What might he not hope for from his great patron, and why should others not share in his success? Furius and Aurelius, scorned by him since their faithlessness in the matter of Juventius, were eager to crawl back into his favor. And they fancied they could bring him a message that would be joyfully greeted, and would secure them the favorable reception they sought for their own advances: Lesbia was willing to recall her recalcitrant lover. She had once before been successful when making the first advances herself (cf. § 19). Why should she fear defeat now? But both she and her ill-chosen emissaries were speedily undeceived. The broken chain of the old love could never be welded again. Catullus had won by absence, by self-discipline, and most of all, perhaps, by real knowledge of facts in the case, the freedom from his passion for which he had prayed (c. 76). He could once more believe in the friendship of Caelius Rufus, and to him acknowledge, with pain, indeed, but no longer with unavailing torture his true view of Lesbia's character (c. 58). And these proffers now made to him through, and by, Furius and Aurelius were definitely and disdainfully rejected (c. 11), -with a manly, not a petulant disdain, for Catullus could not even then forget that he had loved Lesbia>.

42\. This manly utterance was almost the last of the poet's life. A few scattered verses there may have been, closing perhaps with the touching appeal written from Verona (cf. § 56) to his brother-poet, Cornificius, for a word of consolation, but that was all; and sometime in the year 54 B.C., in his beloved Rome, so says the chronicler, the swiftly burning candle of his life burned itself out.

43\. With him died the clearest, if not the richest, poet-voice ever lifted in Rome. He lacked the lofty grandeur of Lucretius, the polished stateliness of Vergil, the broad sympathies of Horace. For on the one hand, he was no recluse to be filled with heavenly visions, and on the other, his personality was too intense to allow him to cultivate a tolerant spirit. He delighted in life with a vigorous animal passion. Not without charm to him was nature in her sylvan aspect (cf. _e.g._ 34.9 ff.) yet his highest enjoyment was in the life of men. And this life he did not study, as did Horace, from the standpoint of a philosopher. Indeed, he did not study it at all, but simply felt it. For he was not outside of it, but a part of it to the fullest degree, swayed by its ever-changing emotions. Such a nature must of necessity ever remain in many essential aspects the nature of a child. And such was the nature of Catullus throughout his brief life,--warm in quick affections, hot in swift hatreds, pulsing with most active red blood.[^8143fe6415424adebd0491fb91362621]

### A story by Polybius about Pisae from Histories



Such parts of both slopes of the Alps as are not too^[The Alps.] rocky or too precipitous are inhabited by different tribes; those on the north towards the Rhone by the Gauls, called Transalpine; those towards the Italian plains by the Taurisci and Agones and a number of other barbarous tribes. The name Transalpine is not tribal, but local, from the Latin proposition _trans,_ "across." The summits of the Alps, from their rugged character, and the great depth of eternal snow, are entirely uninhabited.^[The Apennines.] Both slopes of the Apennines, towards the Tuscan Sea and towards the plains, are inhabited by the Ligurians, from above Marseilles and the Junction with the Alps to Pisae on the cast, the first city on the west of Etruria, and inland to Arretium. Next to them come the Etruscans; and next on both slopes the Umbrians. The distance between the Apennines and the Adriatic averages about five hundred stades; and when it leaves the northern plains the chain verges to the right, and goes entirely through the middle of the rest of Italy, as far as the Sicilian Sea.^[The Po.] The remaining portion of this triangle, namely the plain along the sea coast, extends as far as the town of Sena. The Padus, celebrated by the poets under the name of Eridanus, rises in the Alps near the apex of the triangle, and flows down to the plains with a southerly course; but after reaching the plains, it turns to the east, and flowing through them discharges itself by two mouths into the Adriatic. The larger part of the plain is thus cut off by it, and lies between this river and the Alps to the head of the Adriatic.^[15th July] In body of water it is second to no river in Italy, because the mountain streams, descending from the Alps and Apennines to the plain, one and all flow into it on both sides; and its stream is at its height and beauty about the time^[15th July.] of the rising of the Dog Star, because it is then swollen by the melting snows on those mountains. It is navigable for nearly two thousand stades up stream, the ships entering by the mouth called Olana; for though it is a single main stream to begin with, it branches off into two at the place called Trigoboli, of which streams the northern is called the Padoa, the southern the Olana. At the mouth of the latter there is a harbour affording as safe anchorage as any in the Adriatic. The whole river is called by the country folk the Bodencus. As to the other stories current in Greece about this river,—I mean Phaethon and his fall, and the tears of the poplars and the black clothes of the inhabitants along this stream, which they are said to wear at this day as mourning for Phaethon,—all such tragic incidents I omit for the present, as not being suitable to the kind of work I have in hand; but I shall return to them at some other more fitting opportunity, particularly because Timaeus has shown a strange ignorance of this district.^[Gauls expel Etruscans from the valley of the Po.][^d19f6d835f2e42909a8adef3b5887b66]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Tibur from Divus Augustus



In the winter, he was protected against the inclemency of the weather by a thick toga, four tunics, a shirt, a flannel stomacher, and swathings upon his legs and thighs.^[_Feminalibus et ibiaibus_: Neither the ancient Romans or the Greeks wore breeches, trews, or trowsers, which they despised as barbarian articles of dress. The coverings here mentioned were swathings for the legs and thighs, used mostly in cases of sickness or infirmity, and when otherwise worn, reckoned effeminate. But soon after the Romans became acquainted with the German and Celtic nations, the habit of covering the lower extremities, barbarous as it had been held, was geerally adopted.] In summer, he lay with the doors of his bedchamber open, and frequently in a piazza, refreshed by a bubbling fountain, and a person standing by to fan him. He could not bear even the winter's sun; and at home, never walked in the open air without a broad-brimmed hat on his head. He usually travelled in a litter, and by night; and so slow, that he was two days in going to Praeneste or Tibur. And if he could go to any place by sea, he preferred that mode of travelling. He carefully nourished his health against his many infirmities, avoiding chiefly the free use of the bath; but he was often rubbed with oil, and sweated in a stove; after which he was washed with tepid water, warmed either by a fire, or by being exposed to the heat of the sun. When, upon account of his nerves, he was obliged to have recourse to sea-water, or the waters of Albula,^[Albula. On the left of the road to Tivoli, near the ruins of Adrian's villa. The waters are sulphureous, and the deposit from them causes incrustations on twigs and other matters plunged in the springs. See a curious account of this stream in Gell's Topography, published by Bohn, p. 40.] he was contented with sitting over a wooden tub, which he called by a Spanish name Dureta, and plunging his hands and feet in the water by turns.[^a9770f7c043f43e7bd0853f4f3592869]

### A story by Julius Caesar about Corfinium from Civil War



Domitius's design being discovered, the soldiers who were at Corfinium began to assemble in the evening, and, by means of their tribunes, centurions, and other officers, made known their thoughts to one another: "That they were besieged by Caesar, who had already, in a manner, completed his works: that their general, Domitius, in whose promises of assistance they had placed their chief hope, abandoning all concern for their safety, was contriving to escape privately by flight: that it was therefore incumbent upon them to look also to their own preservation." The Marsi at first opposed this resolution, and possessed themselves of the strongest part of the town; nay, the dispute was so warm, that it almost came to be decided by the sword. But shortly after, being made accquainted with Domitius's intended flight, of which before they had no knowledge; they all, in a body, surrounded Domitius, secured his person, and sent deputies to Caesar: "That they were ready to open their gates, receive his orders, and deliver up Domitius alive."[^98d477b2827748198756ee16b7b29f17]

### A story by Julius Caesar about Corfinium from Civil War



Having dismissed him with these instructions, he arrived before Brundusium with six legions, three of which were composed of veteran soldiers, and the rest of new levies drawn together upon his march; for as to Domitius's troops, he had sent them directly from Corfinium to Sicily. He found the consuls were gone to Dyrrhachium with great part of the army, and that Pompey remained in Brundusium with twenty cohorts. Nor was it certainly known whether he continued there with design to keep possession of Brundusium, that he might be master of the whole Adriatic Sea, the extreme parts of Italy, and the country of Greece, in order to make war on both sides the gulf; or for want of shipping to transport his men. Fearing, therefore, that it was his intention to keep footing in Italy he resolved to deprive him of the advantages he might receive from the port of Brundusium. The works he contrived for this purpose were as follows: He carried on a mole on either side the mouth of the haven where the entrance was narrowest, and the water shallow. But as this work could not be carried quite across the port, by reason of the great depth of the sea, he prepared double floats of timber, thirty feet square, which were each secured by four anchors from the four corners, to enable them to resist the fury of the waves. These, extending all the way between the two moles, were covered over with earth and fascines, that the soldiers might pass and repass with ease, and have firm footing to defend them. The front and sides were armed with a parapet of hurdies, and every fourth float had a tower of two stories, the better to guard the work from fire and the shocks of the vessels.[^438b2bac673a403d927fc41811ec8df1]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Larinum from For Aulus Cluentius



However, there is a sudden divorce, which appeared likely to be a consolation for all her misfortunes. Cluentia departs from Melinus; not unwilling to be released from the infliction of such injuries, yet not willing to lose her husband. But then that admirable and illustrious mother of hers began openly to exult with joy, to triumph in her delight, victorious over her daughter, not over her lust. Therefore she did not choose her reputation to be attacked any longer by uncertain suspicions; she orders that genial bed, which two years before she had decked for her daughter on her marriage, to be decked and prepared for herself in the very same house, having driven and forced her daughter out of it. The mother-in-law marries the son-in-law, no one looking favourably on the deed, no one approving it, all foreboding a dismal end to it.[^5ba1d41a325e4aa8803b1f2c8fa1d706]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Larinum from For Aulus Cluentius



Although there are many things which seem to me necessary to be mentioned respecting the common dangers to which all men are exposed by unpopularity, before I speak about the cause itself; still, that I may not keep your expectations too long in suspense by my speech, I will come to the charge itself, only begging you, O judges, as I am aware I must frequently do in the course of this trial, to listen to me, as if this cause were now being this day pleaded for the first time,—as, in fact, it is; and not as if it had already been often discussed and proved. For on this day opportunity is given us for the first time of effacing that old accusation; up to this time mistake and odium have had the principal influence in the whole cause. Wherefore, while I reply with brevity and clearness to the accusation of many years standing, I entreat you, O judges, to listen to me, as I know that you are predetermined to do, with kindness and attention.[^74cd622e17964750a10bef1272e66833]

### A story by Strabo about Sipontum from Geography



Now that I have traversed the regions of Old Italy^[i.e., Oenotria (see 6. 1. 15 and 5. 1. 1).] as far as Metapontium, I must speak of those that border on them. And Iapygia borders on them. The Greeks call it Messapia, also, but the natives, dividing it into two parts, call one part (that about the Iapygian Cape)^[Cape Leuca.] the country of the Salentini, and the other the country of the Calabri. Above these latter, on the north, are the Peucetii and also those people who in the Greek language are called Daunii, but the natives give the name Apulia to the whole country that comes after that of the Calabri, though some of them, particularly the Peucetii, are called Poedicli also. Messapia forms a sort of peninsula, since it is enclosed by the isthmus that extends from Brentesium^[See 5. 3. 6 and footnote.] as far as Taras, three hundred and ten stadia. And the voyage thither^[From Brentesium to Taras.] around the Iapygian Cape is, all told, about four hundred^[This figure is wrong. Strabo probably wrote 1,200; Groskurd thinks that he wrote 1,400, but in section 5 (below) the figures for the intervals of the same voyage total 1,220 stadia.] stadia. The distance from Metapontium^[To Taras.] is about two hundred and twenty stadia, and the voyage to it is towards the rising sun. But though the whole Tarantine Gulf, generally speaking, is harborless, yet at the city there is a very large and beautiful harbor,^[Mare Piccolo.] which is enclosed by a large bridge and is one hundred stadia in circumference. In that part of the harbor which lies towards the innermost recess,^[i.e., the part that is immediately to the east of the city, as Tozer (op. cit., p. 183) points out.] the harbor, with the outer sea, forms an isthmus, and therefore the city is situated on a peninsula; and since the neck of land is low-lying, the ships are easily hauled overland from either side. The ground of the city, too, is low-lying, but still it is slightly elevated where the acropolis is. The old wall has a large circuit, but at the present time the greater part of the city—the part that is near the isthmus—has been forsaken, but the part that is near the mouth of the harbor, where the acropolis is, still endures and makes up a city of noteworthy size. And it has a very beautiful gymnasium, and also a spacious market-place, in which is situated the bronze colossus of Zeus, the largest in the world except the one that belongs to the Rhodians. Between the marketplace and the mouth of the harbor is the acropolis, which has but few remnants of the dedicated objects that in early times adorned it, for most of them were either destroyed by the Carthaginians when they took the city or carried off as booty by the Romans when they took the place by storm.^[Tarentum revolted from Rome to Hannibal during the Second Punic War, but was recaptured (209 B.C.) and severely dealt with.] Among this booty is the Heracles in the Capitol, a colossal bronze statue, the work of Lysippus, dedicated by Maximus Fabius, who captured the city. In speaking of the founding of Taras, Antiochus says: After the Messenian war^[743-723 B.C.] broke out, those of the Lacedaemonians who did not take part in the expedition were adjudged slaves and were named Helots,^[On the name and its origin, see 8. 5. 4; also Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encycl. s.v. "Heloten."] and all children who were born in the time of the expedition were called Partheniae^["Children of Virgins."] and judicially deprived of the rights of citizenship, but they would not tolerate this, and since they were numerous formed a plot against the free citizens; and when the latter learned of the plot they sent secretly certain men who, through a pretence of friendship, were to report what manner of plot it was; among these was Phalanthus, who was reputed to be their champion, but he was not pleased, in general, with those who had been named to take part in the council. It was agreed, however, that the attack should be made at the Hyacinthian festival in the Amyclaeum^[The temple of Amyclaean Apollo.] when the games were being celebrated, at the moment when Phalanthus should put on his leather cap (the free citizens were recognizable by their hair^[i.e., by the length of it. According to Plut. Lys. 1 the wearing of long hair by the Spartans dated back to Lycurgus (the ninth century B.C.), but according to Hdt. 1.82 they wore their hair short till the battle of Thyrea (in the sixth century B.C.), when by legal enactment they began to wear it long.]); but when Phalanthus and his men had secretly reported the agreement, and when the games were in progress, the herald came forward and forbade Phalanthus to put on a leather cap; and when the plotters perceived that the plot had been revealed, some of them began to run away and others to beg for mercy; but they were bidden to be of good cheer and were given over to custody; Phalanthus, however, was sent to the temple of the god^[At Delphi.] to consult with reference to founding a colony; and the god responded, "I give to thee Satyrium, both to take up thine abode in the rich land of Taras and to become a bane to the Iapygians." Accordingly, the Partheniae went thither with Phalanthus, and they were welcomed by both the barbarians and the Cretans who had previously taken possession of the place. These latter, it is said, are the people who sailed with Minos to Sicily, and, after his death, which occurred at the home of Cocalus in Camici,^[Cp. 6. 2. 6.] set sail from Sicily; but on the voyage back^[Back to Crete.] they were driven out of their course to Taras, although later some of them went afoot around the Adrias^[The Adriatic.] as far as Macedonia and were called Bottiaeans. But all the people as far as Daunia, it is said, were called Iapyges, after Iapyx, who is said to have been the son of Daedalus by a Cretan woman and to have been the leader of the Cretans. The city of Taras, however, was named after some hero. But Ephorus describes the founding of the city thus: The Lacedaemonians were at war with the Messenians because the latter had killed their king Teleclus when he went to Messene to offer sacrifice, and they swore that they would not return home again until they either destroyed Messene or were all killed; and when they set out on the expedition, they left behind the youngest and the oldest of the citizens to guard the city; but later on, in the tenth year of the war, the Lacedaemonian women met together and sent certain of their own number to make complaint to their husbands that they were carrying on the war with the Messenians on unequal terms, for the Messenians, staying in their own country, were begetting children, whereas they, having abandoned their wives to widowhood, were on an expedition in the country of the enemy, and they complained that the fatherland was in danger of being in want of men; and the Lacedaemonians, both keeping their oath and at the same time bearing in mind the argument of the women, sent the men who were most vigorous and at the same time youngest, for they knew that these had not taken part in the oaths, because they were still children when they went out to war along with the men who were of military age; and they ordered them to cohabit with the maidens, every man with every maiden, thinking that thus the maidens would bear many more children; and when this was done, the children were named Partheniae. But as for Messene, it was captured after a war of nineteen years, as Tyrtaeus says: "About it they fought for nineteen years, relentlessly, with heart ever steadfast, did the fathers of our fathers, spearmen they; and in the twentieth the people forsook their fertile farms and fled from the great mountains of Ithome." Now the Lacedaemonians divided up Messenia among themselves, but when they came on back home they would not honor the Partheniae with civic rights like the rest, on the ground that they had been born out of wedlock; and the Partheniae, leaguing with the Helots, formed a plot against the Lacedaemonians and agreed to raise a Laconian cap in the market-place as a signal for the attack. But though some of the Helots had revealed the plot, the Lacedaemonians decided that it would be difficult to make a counter-attack against them, for the Helots were not only numerous but were all of one mind, regarding themselves as virtually brothers of one another, and merely charged those who were about to raise the signal to go away from the marketplace. So the plotters, on learning that the undertaking had been betrayed, held back, and the Lacedaemonians persuaded them, through the influence of their fathers, to go forth and found a colony, and if the place they took possession of sufficed them, to stay there, but if not, to come on back and divide among themselves the fifth part of Messenia. And they, thus sent forth, found the Achaeans at war with the barbarians, took part in their perils, and founded Taras. At one time the Tarantini were exceedingly powerful, that is, when they enjoyed a democratic government; for they not only had acquired the largest fleet of all peoples in that part of the world but were wont to send forth an army of thirty thousand infantry, three thousand cavalry, and one thousand commanders of cavalry. Moreover, the Pythagorean philosophy was embraced by them, but especially by Archytas,^[Archytas (about 427-347 B.C.), besides being chosen seven times as chief magistrate ("strategus") of Tarentum, was famous as general, Pythagorean philosopher, mathematician, and author. Aristotle and Aristoxenus wrote works on his life and writings, but both of these works are now lost.] who presided over the city for a considerable time. But later, because of their prosperity, luxury prevailed to such an extent that the public festivals celebrated among them every year were more in number than the days of the year; and in consequence of this they also were poorly governed. One evidence of their bad policies is the fact that they employed foreign generals; for they sent for Alexander^[Alexander I was appointed king of Epeirus by Philip of Macedonia about 342 B.C., and was killed by a Luecanian about 330 B.C. (cp. 6. 1. 5).] the Molossian to lead them in their war against the Messapians and Leucanians, and, still before that, for Archidamus,^[Archidamus III, king of Sparta, was born about 400 B.C. and lost his life in 338 B.C. in this war.] the son of Agesilaüs, and, later on, for Cleonymus,^[Little is know of this Cleonymus, save that he was the son of Cleomenes II, who reigned at Sparta 370-309 B.C.] and Agathocles,^[Agathocles (b. about 361 B.C.—d. 289 B.C.) was a tyrant of Syracuse. He appears to have led the Tarantini about 300 B.C.] and then for Pyrrhus,^[Pyrrhus (about 318-272 B.C.), king of Epeirus, accepted the invitation of Tarentum in 281 B.C.] at the time when they formed a league with him against the Romans. And yet even to those whom they called in they could not yield a ready obedience, and would set them at enmity. At all events, it was out of enmity that Alexander tried to transfer to Thurian territory the general festival assembly of all Greek peoples in that part of the world—the assembly which was wont to meet at Heracleia in Tarantine territory, and that he began to urge that a place for the meetings be fortified on the Acalandrus River. Furthermore, it is said that the unhappy end which befell him^[6. 1. 5.] was the result of their ingratitude. Again, about the time of the wars with Hannibal, they were deprived of their freedom, although later they received a colony of Romans, and are now living at peace and better than before. In their war against the Messapians for the possession of Heracleia, they had the co-operation of the king of the Daunians and the king of the Peucetians. That part of the country of the Iapygians which comes next is fine, though in an unexpected way; for although on the surface it appears rough, it is found to be deep-soiled when ploughed, and although it is rather lacking in water, it is manifestly none the less good for pasturage and for trees. The whole of this district was once extremely populous; and it also had thirteen cities; but now, with the exception of Taras and Brentesium, all of them are so worn out by war that they are merely small towns. The Salentini are said to be a colony of the Cretans. The temple of Athene, once so rich, is in their territory, as also the look-out-rock called Cape Iapygia, a huge rock which extends out into the sea towards the winter sunrise,^[i.e., south-east.] though it bends approximately towards the Lacinium, which rises opposite to it on the west and with it bars the mouth of the Tarantine Gulf. And with it the Ceraunian Mountains, likewise, bar the mouth of the Ionian Gulf; the passage across from it both to the Ceraunian Mountains and to the Lacinium is about seven hundred stadia. But the distance by sea from Taras around to Brentesium is as follows: First, to the small town of Baris, six hundred stadia; Baris is called by the people of today Veretum, is situated at the edge of the Salentine territory, and the trip thither from Taras is for the most part easier to make on foot than by sailing. Thence to Leuca eighty stadia; this, too, is a small town, and in it is to be seen a fountain of malodorous water; the mythical story is told that those of the Giants who survived at the Campanian Phlegra^[See 5. 4. 4 and 5. 4. 6.] and are called the Leuternian Giants were driven out by Heracles, and on fleeing hither for refuge were shrouded by Mother Earth, and the fountain gets its malodorous stream from the ichor of their bodies; and for this reason, also, the seaboard here is called Leuternia. Again, from Leuca to Hydrus,^[Also called Hydruntum; now Otranto.] a small town, one hundred and fifty stadia. Thence to Brentesium four hundred; and it is an equal distance to the island Sason,^[Now Sasena.] which is situated about midway of the distance across from Epeirus to Brentesium. And therefore those who cannot accomplish the straight voyage sail to the left of Sason and put in at Hydrus; and then, watching for a favorable wind, they hold their course towards the harbors of the Brentesini, although if they disembark, they go afoot by a shorter route by way of Rodiae,^[Also called Rudiae; now Rugge.] a Greek city, where the poet Ennius was born. So then, the district one sails around in going from Taras to Brentesium resembles a peninsula, and the overland journey from Brentesium to Taras, which is only a one day's journey for a man well-girt, forms the isthmus of the aforesaid peninsula;^[6. 3. 1.] and this peninsula most people call by one general name Messapia, or Iapygia, or Calabria, or Salentina, although some divide it up, as I have said before.^[6. 3. 1.] So much, then, for the towns on the seacoast. In the interior are Rodiae and Lupiae, and, slightly above the sea, Aletia; and at the middle of the isthmus, Uria, in which is still to be seen the palace of one of the chieftains. When Herodotus^[7. 170.] states that Hyria is in Iapygia and was founded by the Cretans who strayed from the fleet of Minos when on its way to Sicily,^[Cp. 6. 3. 2.] we must understand Hyria to be either Uria or Veretum. Brentesium, they say, was further colonized by the Cretans, whether by those who came over with Theseus from Cnossus or by those who set sail from Sicily with Iapyx (the story is told both ways), although they did not stay together there, it is said, but went off to Bottiaea.^[Cp. 6. 3. 2, where Antiochus says that some of them went to Bottiaea.] Later on, however, when ruled by kings, the city lost much of its country to the Lacedaemonians who were under the leadership of Phalanthus; but still, when he was ejected from Taras, he was admitted by the Brentesini, and when he died was counted by them worthy of a splendid burial. Their country is better than that of the Tarantini, for, though the soil is thin, it produces good fruits, and its honey and wool are among those that are strongly commended. Brentesium is also better supplied with harbors; for here many harbors are closed in by one mouth; and they are sheltered from the waves, because bays are formed inside in such a way as to resemble in shape a stag's horns;^[So, too, the gulf, or bay, at Byzantium resembles a stag's horn (7. 6. 2).] and hence the name, for, along with the city, the place very much resembles a stag's head, and in the Messapian language the head of the stag is called "brentesium."^[Stephanus Byzantinus says: "According to Seleucus, in his second book on Languages, 'brentium' is the Messapian word for 'the head of the stag.'" Hence the editors who emend "brentesium" to "brentium" are almost certainly correct.] But the Tarantine harbor, because of its wide expanse, is not wholly sheltered from the waves; and besides there are some shallows in the innermost part of it.^[Here, as in 6. 3. 1., Strabo is speaking of the inner harbor (Mare Piccolo), not the outer, of which, as Tozer (p. 184) says, Strabo takes no account.] In the case of those who sail across from Greece or Asia, the more direct route is to Brentesium, and, in fact, all who propose to go to Rome by land put into port here. There are two roads^[On these roads see Ashby and Gardner, The Via Trajana, Paper of the British School at Rome, 1916, Vol.VIII, No. 5, pp. 107 ff.] from here: one, a mule-road through the countries of the Peucetii (who are called Poedicli),^[Cp. 6. 3. 1.] the Daunii, and the Samnitae as far as Beneventum; on this road is the city of Egnatia,^[Also spelled Gnathia, Gnatia, and Ignatia; now Torre d'Agnazzo.] and then, Celia,^[Also spelled Caelia; now Ceglie di Bari.] Netium,^[Now Noja.] Canusium, and Herdonia.^[Now Ordona.] But the road by way of Taras, lying slightly to the left of the other, though as much as one day's journey out of the way when one has made the circuit,^[i.e., to the point where it meets the other road, near Beneventum.] what is called the Appian Way, is better for carriages. On this road are the cities of Uria and Venusia, the former between Taras and Brentesium and the latter on the confines of the Samnitae and the Leucani. Both the roads from Brentesium meet near Beneventum and Campania. And the common road from here on, as far as Rome, is called the Appian Way, and passes through Caudium,^[Now Montesarchio.] Calatia,^[Now Galazze.] Capua,^[The old Santa Maria di Capua, now in ruins; not the Capua of today, which is on the site of Casilinum.] and Casilinum to Sinuessa.^[Now Mondragone.] And the places from there on I have already mentioned. The total length of the road from Rome to Brentesium is three hundred and sixty miles. But there is also a third road, which runs from Rhegium through the countries of the Brettii, the Leucani, and the Samnitae into Campania, where it joins the Appian Way; it passes through the Apennine Mountains and it requires three or four days more than the road from Brentesium. The voyage from Brentesium to the opposite mainland is made either to the Ceraunian Mountains and those parts of the seaboard of Epeirus and of Greece which come next to them, or else to Epidamnus; the latter is longer than the former, for it is one thousand eight hundred stadia.^[Strabo has already said the the voyage from Brentesium to Epeirus by way of Sason (Saseno) was about 800 stadia (6. 3. 5). But Strabo was much out of the way, and apparently was not on the regular route. Again, Epidamnus (now Durazzo) is in fact only about 800 stadia distant, not 1,800 as the text makes Strabo say. It is probable, therefore, that Strabo said either simply " for it is 800 stadia," or "for it is 1,000 stadia, while the former is 800.] And yet the latter is the usual route, because the city has a good position with reference both to the tribes of the Illyrians and to those of the Macedonians. As one sails from Brentesium along the Adriatic seaboard, one comes to the city of Egnatia, which is the common stopping-place for people who are travelling either by sea or land to Barium;^[Now Bari.] and the voyage is made with the south wind. The country of the Peucetii extends only thus far^[To Barium.] on the sea, but in the interior as far as Silvium.^[Silvium appears to have been on the site of what is now Garagone.] All of it is rugged and mountainous, since it embraces a large portion of the Apennine Mountains; and it is thought to have admitted Arcadians as colonists. From Brentesium to Barium is about seven hundred stadia, and Taras is about an equal distance from each. The adjacent country is inhabited by the Daunii; and then come the Apuli, whose country extends as far as that of the Frentani. But since the terms "Peucetii" and "Daunii" are not at all used by the native inhabitants, except in early times, and since this country as a whole is now called Apulia, necessarily the boundaries of these tribes cannot be told to a nicety either, and for this reason neither should I myself make positive assertions about them. From Barium to the Aufidus River, on which is the Emporium of the Canusitae^[This Emporium should probably be identified with the Canne of today (see Ashby and Gardner, op. cit., p. 156).] is four hundred stadia and the voyage inland to Emporium is ninety. Near by is also Salapia,^[Now Salpi.] the seaport of the Argyrippini. For not far above the sea (in the plain, at all events) are situated two cities, Canusium^[Now Canosa.] and Argyrippa,^[Now Arpino.] which in earlier times were the largest of the Italiote cities, as is clear from the circuits of their walls. Now, however, Argyrippa is smaller; it was called Argos Hippium at first, then Argyrippa, and then by the present name Arpi. Both are said to have been founded by Diomedes.^[Cp. 5. 1. 9.] And as signs of the dominion of Diomedes in these regions are to be seen the Plain of Diomedes and many other things, among which are the old votive offerings in the temple of Athene at Luceria—a place which likewise was in ancient times a city of the Daunii, but is now reduced—and, in the sea near by, two islands that are called the Islands of Diomedes, of which one is inhabited, while the other, it is said, is desert; on the latter, according to certain narrators of myths, Diomedes was caused to disappear, and his companions were changed to birds, and to this day, in fact, remain tame and live a sort of human life, not only in their orderly ways but also in their tameness towards honorable men and in their flight from wicked and knavish men. But I have already mentioned the stories constantly told among the Heneti about this hero and the rites which are observed in his honor.^[Cp. 5. 1. 9.] It is thought that Sipus^[In Latin, Sipontum; now in ruins, near Santa Maria di Siponto.] also was founded by Diomedes, which is about one hundred and forty stadia distant from Salapia; at any rate it was named "Sepius" in Greek after the "sepia"^[Cuttle-fish.] that are cast ashore by the waves. Between Salapia and Sinus is a navigable river, and also a large lake that opens into the sea; and the merchandise from Sipus, particularly grain, is brought down on both. In Daunia, on a hill by the name of Drium, are to be seen two hero-temples: one, to Calchas, on the very summit, where those who consult the oracle sacrifice to his shade a black ram and sleep in the hide, and the other, to Podaleirius, down near the base of the hill, this temple being about one hundred stadia distant from the sea; and from it flows a stream which is a cure-all for diseases of animals. In front of this gulf is a promontory, Garganum, which extends towards the east for a distance of three hundred stadia into the high sea; doubling the headland, one comes to a small town, Urium, and off the headland are to be seen the Islands of Diomedes. This whole country produces everything in great quantity, and is excellent for horses and sheep; but though the wool is softer than the Tarantine, it is not so glossy. And the country is well sheltered, because the plains lie in hollows. According to some, Diomedes even tried to cut a canal as far as the sea, but left behind both this and the rest of his undertakings only half-finished, because he was summoned home and there ended his life. This is one account of him; but there is also a second, that he stayed here till the end of his life; and a third, the aforesaid mythical account, which tells of his disappearance in the island; and as a fourth one might set down the account of the Heneti, for they too tell a mythical story of how he in some way came to his end in their country, and they call it his apotheosis. Now the above distances are put down in accordance with the data of Artemidorus;^[Artemidorus (flourished about 100 B.C.), of Ephesus, was an extensive traveller and a geographer of great importance. He wrote a geography of the inhabited world in eleven books, a Periplus of the Mediterranean, and Ionian Historical Sketches. But his works, except numerous fragments preserved in other authors, are now lost.] but according to the Chorographer,^[See 5. 2. 7 and footnote.] the distances from Brentesium as far as Garganum^[Monte Gargano.] amount to one hundred and sixty-five miles, whereas according to Artemidorus they amount to more; and thence to Ancona two hundred and fifty-four miles according to the former, whereas according to Artemidorus the distance to the Aesis River, which is near Ancona, is one thousand two hundred and fifty stadia, a much shorter distance. Polybius states that the distance from Iapygia has been marked out by miles, and that the distance to the city of Sena^[Sena Gallica; now Sinigaglia.] is five hundred and sixty-two miles, and thence to Aquileia one hundred and seventy-eight. And they do not agree with the commonly accepted distance along the Illyrian coastline, from the Ceraunian Mountains to the recess of the Adrias,^[The Adriatic.] since they represent this latter coasting voyage as over six thousand stadia,^[Polybius here gives the total length of the coastline on the Italian side as 740 miles, or 6,166 stadia (8 1/3 stadia to the mile; see 7. 7. 4), and elsewhere (2. 4. 3) Strabo quotes him as reckoning the length of the Illyrian coastline from the Ceraunian Mts. only to Iapygia (not including Istria) as 6,150 stadia. Cp. also 7. 5. 3, 4, 10.] thus making it even longer than the former, although it is much shorter. However, every writer does not agree with every other, particularly about the distances, as I often say.^[Cp. 1. 2. 13; 2. 1. 7-8, and 2. 4. 3.] As for myself, where it is possible to reach a decision, I set forth my opinion, but where it is not, I think that I should make known the opinions of others. And when I have no opinion of theirs, there is no occasion for surprise if I too have passed something by, especially when one considers the character of my subject; for I would not pass by anything important, while as for little things, not only do they profit one but slightly if known, but their omission escapes unnoticed, and detracts not at all, or else not much, from the completeness of the work.^[Cp. 1. 1. 23.] The intervening space, immediately after Cape Garganum, is taken up by a deep gulf; the people who live around it are called by the special name of Apuli, although they speak the same language as the Daunii and the Peucetii, and do not differ from them in any other respect either, at the present time at least, although it is reasonable to suppose that in early times they differed and that this is the source of the three diverse names for them that are now prevalent. In earlier times this whole country was prosperous, but it was laid waste by Hannibal and the later wars. And here too occurred the battle of Cannae, in which the Romans and their allies suffered a very great loss of life. On the gulf is a lake; and above the lake, in the interior, is Teanum Apulum,^[Passo di Civita.] which has the same name as Teanum Sidicinum. At this point the breadth of Italy seems to be considerably contracted, since from here to the region of Dicaearcheia^[Puteoli.] an isthmus is left of less than one thousand stadia from sea to sea. After the lake comes the voyage along the coast to the country of the Frentani and to Buca;^[Now Termoli.] and the distance from the lake either to Buca or to Cape Garganum is two hundred stadia. As for the places that come next after Buca, I have already mentioned them.^[5. 4. 2.][^c5cc5ac651134c86bf0e51a13cfe71ac]

### A story by Flavius Josephus about Barium from Jewish Antiquities



Jacob, encouraged by this dream, went on more cheerfully for Egypt with his sons, and all belonging to them. Now they were in all seventy. I once, indeed, thought it best not to set down the names of this family, especially because of their difficult pronunciation [by the Greeks]; but, upon the whole, I think it necessary to mention those names, that I may disprove such as believe that we came not originally from Mesopotamia, but are Egyptians. Now Jacob had twelve sons; of these Joseph was come thither before. We will therefore set down the names of Jacob's children and grandchildren. Reuben had four sons - Anoch, Phallu, Assaron, Charmi. Simeon had six - Jamuel, Jamin, Avod, Jachin, Soar, Saul. Levi had three sons - Gersom, Caath, Merari. Judas had three sons - Sala, Phares, Zerah; and by Phares two grandchildren, Esrom and Amar. Issachar had four sons - Thola, Phua, Jasob, Samaron. Zabulon had with him three sons - Sarad, Helon, Jalel. So far is the posterity of Lea; with whom went her daughter Dinah. These are thirty-three. Rachel had two sons, the one of whom, Joseph, had two sons also, Manasses and Ephraim. The other, Benjamin, had ten sons - Bolau, Bacchar, Asabel, Geras, Naaman, Jes, Ros, Momphis, Opphis, Arad. These fourteen added to the thirty-three before enumerated, amount to the number forty-seven. And this was the legitimate posterity of Jacob. He had besides by Bilhah, the handmaid of Rachel, Dan and Nephtliali; which last had four sons that followed him - Jesel, Guni, Issari, and Sellim. Dan had an only begotten son, Usi. If these be added to those before mentioned, they complete the number fifty-four. Gad and Aser were the sons of Zilpha, who was the handmaid of Lea. These had with them, Gad seven - Saphoniah, Augis, Sunis, Azabon, Aerin, Erocd, Ariel. Aser had a daughter, Sarah, and six male children, whose names were Jomne, Isus, Isoui, Baris, Abar and Melchiel. If we add these, which are sixteen, to the fifty-four, the forementioned number [70] is completed^[All the Greek copies of Josephus have the negative particle here, that Jacob himself was not reckoned one of the 70 souls that came into Egypt; but the old Latin copies want it, and directly assure us he was one of them. It is therefore hardly certain which of these was Josephus's true reading, since the number 70 is made up without him, if we reckon Leah for one; but if she be not reckoned, Jacob must himself be one, to complete the number.] Jacob not being himself included in that number.[^cd1084c5cda1479da22bf74414752e5c]

### A story by Julius Caesar about Salona from Civil War



After the departure of the Liburnian his command, sailed from Illyricum, and came before Salona. Having spirited up the Dalmatians, and other barbarous nations in those parts, he drew Issa to revolt from Caesar. But finding that the council of Salona was neither to be moved by promises nor threats, he resolved to invest the town. Salona is built upon a hill, and advantageously situated for defence; but as the fortifications were very inconsiderable, the Roman citizens, residing there, immediately surrounded the place with wooden towers; and finding themselves too few to resist the attacks of the enemy, who soon overwhelmed them with wounds, betook themselves to their last refuge, by granting liberty to all slaves capable of bearing arms, and cutting off the women's hair, to make cords for their engines. Octavius perceiving their obstinacy, formed five different camps round the town, that they might at once suffer all the inconveniences of a siege, and be exposed to frequent attacks. The Salonians, determined to endure any thing, found themselves most pressed for want of corn; and therefore sent deputies to Caesar to solicit a supply, patiently submitting to all the other hardships they laboured under. When the siege had now continued a considerable time, and the Octavians began to be off their guard, the Salonians, finding the opportunity favourable, about noon, when the enemy were dispersed, disposed their wives and children upon the walls, that every thing might have its wonted appearance; and sallying in a body with their enfranchised slaves, attacked the nearest quarters of Octavius. Having soon forced these, they advanced to the next; thence to a third, a fourth, and so on through the rest; till having driven the enemy from every post, and made great slaughter of their men, they at length compelled them, and Octavius their leader, to betake themselves to their ships. Such was the issue of the siege. As winter now approached, and the loss had been very considerable; Octavius, despairing to reduce the place, retired to Dyrrhachium, and joined Pompey.[^cbb3eb16b396443eb7ba6afa0d6cd912]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Larinum from For Aulus Cluentius



Aulus Cluentius is said to have corrupted a tribunal with money, in order to procure the condemnation of his innocent enemy, Statius Albius. I will prove, O judges, in the first place, (since that is the principal wickedness charged against him, and the chief pretext for casting odium upon him, that an innocent man was condemned through the influence of in your minds whether I have money,) that no one was ever brought before a court on heavier charges, or with more unimpeachable witnesses against him to prove them. In the second place, that a previous examination into the matter had been made by the very same judges who afterwards condemned him, with such a result that he could not possibly have been acquitted, not only by them, but by any other imaginable tribunal. When I have demonstrated this, then I will prove that point which I am aware is particularly indispensable, that that tribunal was indeed tampered with, not by Cluentius, but by the party hostile to Cluentius; and I will enable you to see clearly in the whole of that cause what the facts really were—what mistake gave rise to—and what had its origin in the unpopularity undeservedly stirred up against Cluentius.[^286e6c12e9b34c39a430ac615150b678]

### A story by Titus Livius (Livy) about Roma from The History of Rome, Book 1



Then the Alban army, who had been watching the fight, marched down into the plain. Mettius congratulated Tullus on his victory, Tullus replied in a friendly tone, and as a mark of goodwill, ordered the Albans to form their camp contiguous to that of the Romans, and made preparations for a "lustral sacrifice"^[lustral sacrifices —These were offered on behalf of the whole army to the war-god Mars, the victims being a boar, a ram, and a bull. See also note 3, book III.] on the morrow. As soon as it was light, and all the preparations were made, he gave the customary order for both armies to muster on parade. The heralds began at the furthest part of the camp, where the Albans were, and summoned them first of all; they, attracted by the novelty of hearing the Roman addressing his troops, took up their position close round him. Secret instructions had been given for the Roman legion to stand fully armed behind them, and the centurions were in readiness to execute instantly the orders they received.

Tullus commenced as follows: "Romans! if in any war that you have ever waged there has been reason for you to thank, first, the immortal gods, and then your own personal courage, such was certainly the case in yesterday's battle. For whilst you had to contend with an open enemy, you had a still more serious and dangerous conflict to maintain against the treachery and perfidy of your allies. For I must undeceive you-it was by no command of mine that the Albans withdrew to the mountains. What you heard was not a real order but a pretended one, which I used as an artifice to prevent your knowing that you were deserted, and so losing heart for the battle, and also to fill the enemy with alarm and a desire to flee by making them think that they were being surrounded. The guilt which I am denouncing does not involve all the Albans; they only followed their general, just as you would have done had I wanted to lead my army away from the field. It is Mettius who is the leader of this march, Mettius who engineered this war, Mettius who broke the treaty between Rome and Alba. Others may venture on similar practices, if I do not make this man a signal lesson to all the world." The armed centurions closed round Mettius, and the king proceeded: "I shall take a course which will bring good fortune and happiness to the Roman people and myself, and to you, Albans; it is my intention to transfer the entire Alban population to Rome, to give the rights of citizenship to the plebeians, and enrol the nobles in the senate, and to make one City, one State. As formerly the Alban State was broken up into two nations, so now let it once more become one," The Alban soldiery listened to these words with conflicting feelings, but unarmed as they were and hemmed in by armed men, a common fear kept them silent. Then Tullus said: "Mettius Fufetius! if you could have learnt to keep your word and respect treaties, I would have given you that instruction in your lifetime, but now, since your character is past cure, do at least teach mankind by your punishment to hold those things as sacred which have been outraged by you. As yesterday your interest was divided between the Fidenates and the Romans, so now you shall give up your body to be divided and dismembered." Thereupon two four-horse chariots were brought up, and Mettius was bound at full length to each, the horses were driven in opposite directions, carrying off parts of the body in each chariot, where the limbs had been secured by the cords. All present averted their eyes from the horrible spectacle. This is the first and last instance amongst the Romans of a punishment so regardless of humanity. Amongst other things which are the glory of Rome is this, that no nation has ever been contented with milder punishments.[^674fb0fdbd7049c2bc1f45376bd76d08]

### A story by Titus Livius (Livy) about Roma from The History of Rome, Book 1



There^[Numa Pompilius elected King.] was living, in those days, at Cures, a Sabine city, a man of renowned justice and piety-Numa Pompilius. He was as conversant as any one in that age could be with all divine and human law. His master is given as Pythagoras of Samos, as tradition speaks of no other. But this is erroneous, for it is generally agreed that it was more than a century later, in the reign of Servius Tullius, that Pythagoras gathered round him crowds of eager students, in the most distant part of Italy, in the neighbourhood of Metapontum, Heraclea, and Crotona. Now, even if he had been contemporary with Numa, how could his reputation have reached the Sabines? From what places, and in what common language could he have induced any one to become his disciple? Who could have guaranteed the safety of a solitary individual travelling through so many nations differing in speech and character? I believe rather that Numa's virtues were the result of his native temperament and self-training, moulded not so much by foreign influences as by the rigorous and austere discipline of the ancient Sabines, which was the purest type of any that existed in the old days.

When Numa's name was mentioned, though the Roman senators saw that the balance of power would be on the side of the Sabines if the king were chosen from amongst them, still no one ventured to propose a partisan of his own, or any senator, or citizen in preference to him. Accordingly they all to a man decreed that the crown should be offered to Numa Pompilius. He was invited to Rome, and following the precedent set by Romulus, when he obtained his crown through the augury which sanctioned the founding of the City, Numa ordered that in his case also the gods should be consulted. He was solemnly conducted by an augur, who was afterwards honoured by being made a State functionary for life, to the Citadel, and took his seat on a stone facing south. The augur seated himself on his left hand, with his head covered, and holding in his right hand a curved staff without any knots, which they called a "_lituus_." After surveying the prospect over the City and surrounding country, he offered prayers and marked out the heavenly regions by an imaginary line from east to west; the southern he defined as "the right hand," the northern as "the left hand." He then fixed upon an object, as far as he could see, as a corresponding mark, and then transferring the lituus to his left hand, he laid his right upon Numa's head and offered this prayer: "Father Jupiter, if it be heaven's will that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be king of Rome, do thou signify it to us by sure signs within those boundaries which I have traced." Then he described in the usual formula the augury which he desired should be sent. They were sent, and Numa being by them manifested to be king, came down from the "_templum_."^[_templum_ —In taking auspices, the augur or magistrate marked out a rectangular space by noting certain objects, trees or what not, within which the desired signs were to appear, and tracing a corresponding area mentally in the sky. The spot where he took his station, the _auguraculum_, was also a small rectangular space; each of these was called a templum. All important magisterial acts were preceded by auspices, and the word templum was extended to denote the position occupied by the magistrate, such as the senate-house, the platform from which the Assembly was addressed, etc.][^bd9c8c2fc65b47efbbeea8f21c7d9f88]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Ocriculum from Historiae



While these successes were being achieved on the side of Vitellius, the army of Vespasian had left Narnia, and was passing the holiday of the Saturnalia in idleness at Ocriculum. The reason alleged for so injurious a delay was that they might wait for Mucianus. Some persons indeed there were who assailed Antonius with insinuations, that he lingered with treacherous intent, after receiving private letters from Vitellius, which conveyed to him the offer of the consulship and of the Emperor's daughter in marriage with a vast dowry, as the price of treason. Others asserted that this was all a fiction, invented to please Mucianus. Some again alleged that the policy agreed upon by all the generals was to threaten rather than actually to attack the capital, as Vitellius' strongest cohorts had revolted from him, and it seemed likely that, deprived of all support, he would abdicate the throne, but that the whole plan was ruined by the impatience and subsequent cowardice of Sabinus, who, after rashly taking up arms, had not been able to defend against three cohorts the great stronghold of the Capitol, which might have defied even the mightiest armies. One cannot, however, easily fix upon one man the blame which belongs to all. Mucianus did in fact delay the conquerors by ambig-^[COSTLY DELAY OF FLAVIANISTS] uously-worded dispatches; Antonius, by a perverse acquiescence, or by an attempt to throw the odium upon another, laid himself open to blame; the other generals, by imagining that the war was over, contrived a distinction for its closing scene. Even Petilius Cerialis, though he had been sent on with a thousand cavalry by cross roads through the Sabine district so as to enter Rome by the Via Salaria, had not been sufficiently prompt in his movements, when the report of the siege of the Capitol put all alike on the alert.[^ec032430a26645eb8b0f6057f7ef5dd9]

Finding all their hopes cut off, the troops of Vitellius, intending to pass over to the side of the conqueror, but to do so with honour, marched down with their standards and colours into the plains beneath Narnia. The army of Vespasian, prepared and equipped as if for action, was drawn up in dense array on both sides of the road. The Vitellianists were received between the two columns; when they were thus surrounded, Antonius addressed them kindly. One division was ordered to remain at Narnia, another at Interamna; with them were left some of the victorious legions, which would not be formidable to them if they remained quiet, but were strong enough to crush all turbulence. At the same time Primus and Varus did not neglect to forward continual messages to Vitellius, offering him personal safety, the enjoyment of wealth, and a quiet retreat in Campania, provided he would lay down his arms and surrender himself and his children to Vespasian. Mucianus also wrote to him to the same effect, and Vitellius was often disposed to trust these overtures, and even discussed the number of his household and the choice of a residence on the coast. Such a lethargy had come over his spirit, that, had not others remembered he had been an Emperor, he would have himself forgotten it.[^5fe4c410028e463c920fcd931274f719]

On a certain unpopular Cominins, perhaps one of two brothers from Spoletium, P. and C. or L. Cominius, who are mentioned by Cicero (Cic. Cluent. 100) as prosecutors. In the year 66 B.C. a popular tumult terrified them into giving up their prosecution of C. Cornelius, though one of them, in spite of general unpopularity, resumed it the following year, on which occasion Cornelius was defended by Cicero.

cana senectus: cf. Catul. 61.162 cana anilitas .

Virgil departed from Spoletium, intending to travel by road to Fanum Fortunae, a 90.170252665 mile journey. 

### A story by Vitruvius Pollio about Fanum Fortunae from On Architecture



1\. THE Greeks lay out their forums in the form of a square surrounded by very spacious double colonnades, adorn them with columns set rather closely together, and with entablatures of stone or marble, and construct walks above in the upper story. But in the cities of Italy the same method cannot be followed, for the reason that it is a custom handed down from our ancestors that gladiatorial shows should be given in the forum.

2\. Therefore let the intercolumniations round the show place be pretty wide; round about in the colonnades put the bankers' offices; and have balconies on the upper floor properly arranged so as to be convenient, and to bring in some public revenue.

The size of a forum should be proportionate to the number of inhabitants, so that it may not be too small a space to be useful, nor look like a desert waste for lack of population. To determine its breadth, divide its length into three parts and assign two of them to the breadth. Its shape will then be oblong, and its ground plan conveniently suited to the conditions of shows.

3\. The columns of the upper tier should be one fourth smaller than those of the lower, because, for the purpose of bearing the load, what is below ought to be stronger than what is above, and also, because we ought to imitate nature as seen in the case of things growing; for example, in round smooth-stemmed trees, like the fir, cypress, and pine, every one of which is rather thick just above the roots and then, as it goes on increasing in height, tapers off naturally and symmetrically in growing up to the top. Hence, if nature requires this in things growing, it is the right arrangement that what is above should be less in height and thickness than what is below.

4\. Basilicas should be constructed on a site adjoining the forum and in the warmest possible quarter, so that in winter business men may gather in them without being troubled by the weather. In breadth they should be not less than one third nor more than one half of their length, unless the site is naturally such as to prevent this and to oblige an alteration in these proportions. If the length of the site is greater than necessary, Chalcidian porches may be constructed at the ends, as in the Julia Aquiliana.

5\. It is thought that the columns of basilicas ought to be as high as the side-aisles are broad; an aisle should be limited to one third of the breadth which the open space in the middle is to have. Let the columns of the upper tier be smaller than those of the lower, as written above. The screen, to be placed between the upper and the lower tiers of columns, ought to be, it is thought, one fourth lower than the columns of the upper tier, so that people walking in the upper story of the basilica may not be seen by the business men. The architraves, friezes, and cornices should be adjusted to the proportions of the columns, as we have stated in the third book.

6\. But basilicas of the greatest dignity and beauty may also be constructed in the style of that one which I erected, and the building of which I superintended at Fano. Its proportions and symmetrical relations were established as follows. In the middle, the main roof between the columns is 120 feet long and sixty feet wide. Its aisle round the space beneath the main roof and between the walls and the columns is twenty feet broad. The columns, of unbroken height, measuring with their capitals fifty feet, and being each five feet thick, have behind them pilasters, twenty feet high, two and one half feet broad, and one and one half feet thick, which support the beams on which is carried the upper flooring of the aisles. Above them are other pilasters, eighteen feet high, two feet broad, and a foot thick, which carry the beams supporting the principal raftering and the roof of the aisles, which is brought down lower than the main roof.

7\. The spaces remaining between the beams supported by the pilasters and the columns, are left for windows between the intercolumniations. The columns are: on the breadth of the main roof at each end, four, including the corner columns at right and left; on the long side which is next to the forum, eight, including the same corner columns; on the other side, six, including the corner columns. This is because the two middle columns on that side are omitted, in order not to obstruct the view of the pronaos of the temple of Augustus (which is built at the middle of the side wall of the basilica, facing the middle of the forum and the temple of Jupiter) and also the tribunal which is in the former temple, shaped as a hemicycle whose curvature is less than a semicircle.

8\. The open side of this hemicycle is forty-six feet along the front, and its curvature inwards is fifteen feet, so that those who are standing before the magistrates may not be in the way of the business men in the basilica. Round about, above the columns, are placed the architraves, consisting of three two-foot timbers fastened together. These return from the columns which stand third on the inner side to the antae which project from the pronaos, and which touch the edges of the hemicycle at right and left.

9\. Above the architraves and regularly dispersed on supports directly over the capitals, piers are placed, three feet high and four feet broad each way. Above them is placed the projecting cornice round about, made of two two-foot timbers. The tiebeams and struts, being placed above them, and directly over the shafts of the columns and the antae and walls of the pronaos, hold up one gable roof along the entire basilica, and another from the middle of it, over the pronaos of the temple.

10\. Thus the gable tops run in two directions, like the letter T, and give a beautiful effect to the outside and inside of the main roof. Further, by the omission of an ornamental entablature and of a line of screens and a second tier of columns, troublesome labour is saved and the total cost greatly diminished. On the other hand, the carrying of the columns themselves in unbroken height directly up to the beams that support the main roof, seems to add an air of sumptuousness and dignity to the work.[^a6f840a084cd400381fbd6a9ceaa2eaa]

### A story by Julius Caesar about Fanum Fortunae from Civil War



It was, by no means, a fair proposal, that Caesar should be obliged to quite Rimini and return to Gaul, while Pompey held provinces and legions that were none of his: that he should dismiss his army, whilst the other was levying troops: and, that only a general promise of going into Spain should be given, without fixing a day for his departure; by which evasion, was he to be found in Italy, even at the expiration of Caesar's consulship, he could not yet be charged with breach of faith. His forbearing too to appoint a time for a conference, and declining to approach nearer, gave little reason to hope for a peace. He therefore sent Antony to Arretium, with five cohorts; remained himself at Rimini, with two, where he resolved to levy troops; and seizing Pisaurum, Fanum, and Ancona, left a cohort in each for a garrison.[^883ecb3d5ed5459794da232641dc480e]

On a certain unpopular Cominins, perhaps one of two brothers from Spoletium, P. and C. or L. Cominius, who are mentioned by Cicero (Cic. Cluent. 100) as prosecutors. In the year 66 B.C. a popular tumult terrified them into giving up their prosecution of C. Cornelius, though one of them, in spite of general unpopularity, resumed it the following year, on which occasion Cornelius was defended by Cicero.

cana senectus: cf. Catul. 61.162 cana anilitas .

spurcata impuris moribus: the hoary head that should be a crown of glory is to him but a mark of confirmed infamy.

bonorum: perhaps in the sense of _optimatium_ (as often in Cicero), if this Cominius was one of the prosecutors.

lingua exsecta: cf. Cic. Cluent. 187 Stratonem in crucem esse actum exsecta scitote lingua .

sit data: perfect, followed by the present _voret_, since the loss of the tongue, as a punishment for his perjuries, would be inflicted upon him before his execution and the throwing of his body to the crows and their associates.

vulturio: cf. Catul. 68.124n.

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Narnia from Historiae



Finding all their hopes cut off, the troops of Vitellius, intending to pass over to the side of the conqueror, but to do so with honour, marched down with their standards and colours into the plains beneath Narnia. The army of Vespasian, prepared and equipped as if for action, was drawn up in dense array on both sides of the road. The Vitellianists were received between the two columns; when they were thus surrounded, Antonius addressed them kindly. One division was ordered to remain at Narnia, another at Interamna; with them were left some of the victorious legions, which would not be formidable to them if they remained quiet, but were strong enough to crush all turbulence. At the same time Primus and Varus did not neglect to forward continual messages to Vitellius, offering him personal safety, the enjoyment of wealth, and a quiet retreat in Campania, provided he would lay down his arms and surrender himself and his children to Vespasian. Mucianus also wrote to him to the same effect, and Vitellius was often disposed to trust these overtures, and even discussed the number of his household and the choice of a residence on the coast. Such a lethargy had come over his spirit, that, had not others remembered he had been an Emperor, he would have himself forgotten it.[^6413773d9b744e258b570d1291f72ab4]

### A story by Vitruvius Pollio about Fanum Fortunae from On Architecture



1\. THE Greeks lay out their forums in the form of a square surrounded by very spacious double colonnades, adorn them with columns set rather closely together, and with entablatures of stone or marble, and construct walks above in the upper story. But in the cities of Italy the same method cannot be followed, for the reason that it is a custom handed down from our ancestors that gladiatorial shows should be given in the forum.

2\. Therefore let the intercolumniations round the show place be pretty wide; round about in the colonnades put the bankers' offices; and have balconies on the upper floor properly arranged so as to be convenient, and to bring in some public revenue.

The size of a forum should be proportionate to the number of inhabitants, so that it may not be too small a space to be useful, nor look like a desert waste for lack of population. To determine its breadth, divide its length into three parts and assign two of them to the breadth. Its shape will then be oblong, and its ground plan conveniently suited to the conditions of shows.

3\. The columns of the upper tier should be one fourth smaller than those of the lower, because, for the purpose of bearing the load, what is below ought to be stronger than what is above, and also, because we ought to imitate nature as seen in the case of things growing; for example, in round smooth-stemmed trees, like the fir, cypress, and pine, every one of which is rather thick just above the roots and then, as it goes on increasing in height, tapers off naturally and symmetrically in growing up to the top. Hence, if nature requires this in things growing, it is the right arrangement that what is above should be less in height and thickness than what is below.

4\. Basilicas should be constructed on a site adjoining the forum and in the warmest possible quarter, so that in winter business men may gather in them without being troubled by the weather. In breadth they should be not less than one third nor more than one half of their length, unless the site is naturally such as to prevent this and to oblige an alteration in these proportions. If the length of the site is greater than necessary, Chalcidian porches may be constructed at the ends, as in the Julia Aquiliana.

5\. It is thought that the columns of basilicas ought to be as high as the side-aisles are broad; an aisle should be limited to one third of the breadth which the open space in the middle is to have. Let the columns of the upper tier be smaller than those of the lower, as written above. The screen, to be placed between the upper and the lower tiers of columns, ought to be, it is thought, one fourth lower than the columns of the upper tier, so that people walking in the upper story of the basilica may not be seen by the business men. The architraves, friezes, and cornices should be adjusted to the proportions of the columns, as we have stated in the third book.

6\. But basilicas of the greatest dignity and beauty may also be constructed in the style of that one which I erected, and the building of which I superintended at Fano. Its proportions and symmetrical relations were established as follows. In the middle, the main roof between the columns is 120 feet long and sixty feet wide. Its aisle round the space beneath the main roof and between the walls and the columns is twenty feet broad. The columns, of unbroken height, measuring with their capitals fifty feet, and being each five feet thick, have behind them pilasters, twenty feet high, two and one half feet broad, and one and one half feet thick, which support the beams on which is carried the upper flooring of the aisles. Above them are other pilasters, eighteen feet high, two feet broad, and a foot thick, which carry the beams supporting the principal raftering and the roof of the aisles, which is brought down lower than the main roof.

7\. The spaces remaining between the beams supported by the pilasters and the columns, are left for windows between the intercolumniations. The columns are: on the breadth of the main roof at each end, four, including the corner columns at right and left; on the long side which is next to the forum, eight, including the same corner columns; on the other side, six, including the corner columns. This is because the two middle columns on that side are omitted, in order not to obstruct the view of the pronaos of the temple of Augustus (which is built at the middle of the side wall of the basilica, facing the middle of the forum and the temple of Jupiter) and also the tribunal which is in the former temple, shaped as a hemicycle whose curvature is less than a semicircle.

8\. The open side of this hemicycle is forty-six feet along the front, and its curvature inwards is fifteen feet, so that those who are standing before the magistrates may not be in the way of the business men in the basilica. Round about, above the columns, are placed the architraves, consisting of three two-foot timbers fastened together. These return from the columns which stand third on the inner side to the antae which project from the pronaos, and which touch the edges of the hemicycle at right and left.

9\. Above the architraves and regularly dispersed on supports directly over the capitals, piers are placed, three feet high and four feet broad each way. Above them is placed the projecting cornice round about, made of two two-foot timbers. The tiebeams and struts, being placed above them, and directly over the shafts of the columns and the antae and walls of the pronaos, hold up one gable roof along the entire basilica, and another from the middle of it, over the pronaos of the temple.

10\. Thus the gable tops run in two directions, like the letter T, and give a beautiful effect to the outside and inside of the main roof. Further, by the omission of an ornamental entablature and of a line of screens and a second tier of columns, troublesome labour is saved and the total cost greatly diminished. On the other hand, the carrying of the columns themselves in unbroken height directly up to the beams that support the main roof, seems to add an air of sumptuousness and dignity to the work.[^3c5f039e8bcc40b0a861c9d66b792ad1]

Antonius marched by the Via Flaminia, and arrived at Saxa Rubra, when the night was far spent, too late to give any help. There he received nothing but gloomy intelligence, that Sabinus was dead, that the Capitol had been burnt to the ground, that Rome was in consternation, and also that the populace and the slaves were arming themselves for Vitellius. And Petilius Cerialis had been defeated in a cavalry skirmish. While he was hurrying on without caution, as against a vanquished enemy, the Vitellianists, who had disposed some infantry among their cavalry, met him. The conflict took place not far from the city among buildings, gardens, and winding lanes, which were well known to the Vitellianists, but disconcerting to their opponents, to whom they were strange. Nor indeed were all the cavalry one in heart, for there were with them some who had lately capitulated at Narnia, and who were anxiously watching the fortunes of the rival parties. Tullius Flavianus, commanding a squadron, was taken prisoner; the rest fled in disgraceful confusion, but the victors did not continue the pursuit beyond Fidenæ.[^133bc31ed115479f8e3bad446bb60ecb]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Ocriculum from Historiae



While these successes were being achieved on the side of Vitellius, the army of Vespasian had left Narnia, and was passing the holiday of the Saturnalia in idleness at Ocriculum. The reason alleged for so injurious a delay was that they might wait for Mucianus. Some persons indeed there were who assailed Antonius with insinuations, that he lingered with treacherous intent, after receiving private letters from Vitellius, which conveyed to him the offer of the consulship and of the Emperor's daughter in marriage with a vast dowry, as the price of treason. Others asserted that this was all a fiction, invented to please Mucianus. Some again alleged that the policy agreed upon by all the generals was to threaten rather than actually to attack the capital, as Vitellius' strongest cohorts had revolted from him, and it seemed likely that, deprived of all support, he would abdicate the throne, but that the whole plan was ruined by the impatience and subsequent cowardice of Sabinus, who, after rashly taking up arms, had not been able to defend against three cohorts the great stronghold of the Capitol, which might have defied even the mightiest armies. One cannot, however, easily fix upon one man the blame which belongs to all. Mucianus did in fact delay the conquerors by ambig-^[COSTLY DELAY OF FLAVIANISTS] uously-worded dispatches; Antonius, by a perverse acquiescence, or by an attempt to throw the odium upon another, laid himself open to blame; the other generals, by imagining that the war was over, contrived a distinction for its closing scene. Even Petilius Cerialis, though he had been sent on with a thousand cavalry by cross roads through the Sabine district so as to enter Rome by the Via Salaria, had not been sufficiently prompt in his movements, when the report of the siege of the Capitol put all alike on the alert.[^b711bf370e444489a14ca9ccce0364be]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Narnia from Historiae



Vitellius, when informed of these events, left a portion of his army at Narnia under the command of the prefect of the Prætorian Guard, and deputed his brother Lucius with six cohorts of infantry and 500 cavalry to encounter the danger that now threatened him on the side of Campania. Sick at heart, he found relief in the zeal of the soldiers and in the shouts with which the people clamoured for arms, while he gave the delusive name of an army and of Roman legions to a cowardly mob, that would not venture on any thing beyond words. At the instance of his freedmen (for his friends were the less faithful the more distinguished their rank) he ordered the tribes to be convoked, and to those who gave in their names administered the oath of service. As the numbers were excessive, he divided the business of enrolment between the consuls. He required the Senators to furnish a prescribed number of slaves and a certain weight of silver. The Roman Knights offered their services and money, and even the freedmen voluntarily sought the privilege of doing the same. This pretence of loyalty, dictated at first by fear, passed into enthusiasm, and many expressed compassion, not so much for Vitellius, as for the fallen condition of the Imperial power. Vitellius himself failed not to draw out their sympathies by his pitiable looks, his voice, and his tears; he was liberal in his^[GENERAL DEFECTION FROM VITELLIUS] promises and even extravagant, as men in their alarm naturally are. He even expressed a wish to be saluted as Cæsar, a title which he had formerly rejected. But now he had a superstitious feeling about the name; and it is a fact that in the moment of terror the counsels of the wise and the voice of the rabble are listened to with equal respect. But as all movements that originate in thoughtless impulse, however vigorous in their beginnings, become feeble after a time, the throng of Senators and Knights gradually melted away, dispersing at first tardily and during the absence of the Emperor, but before long with a contemptuous indifference to his presence, till, ashamed of the failure of his efforts, Vitellius waived his claims to services which were not offered.[^641804b87f964cc790599ffbce4d2ff6]

Virgil departed from Narnia, intending to travel by road to Ocriculum, a 8.118212115 mile journey. 

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Ocriculum from Historiae



While these successes were being achieved on the side of Vitellius, the army of Vespasian had left Narnia, and was passing the holiday of the Saturnalia in idleness at Ocriculum. The reason alleged for so injurious a delay was that they might wait for Mucianus. Some persons indeed there were who assailed Antonius with insinuations, that he lingered with treacherous intent, after receiving private letters from Vitellius, which conveyed to him the offer of the consulship and of the Emperor's daughter in marriage with a vast dowry, as the price of treason. Others asserted that this was all a fiction, invented to please Mucianus. Some again alleged that the policy agreed upon by all the generals was to threaten rather than actually to attack the capital, as Vitellius' strongest cohorts had revolted from him, and it seemed likely that, deprived of all support, he would abdicate the throne, but that the whole plan was ruined by the impatience and subsequent cowardice of Sabinus, who, after rashly taking up arms, had not been able to defend against three cohorts the great stronghold of the Capitol, which might have defied even the mightiest armies. One cannot, however, easily fix upon one man the blame which belongs to all. Mucianus did in fact delay the conquerors by ambig-^[COSTLY DELAY OF FLAVIANISTS] uously-worded dispatches; Antonius, by a perverse acquiescence, or by an attempt to throw the odium upon another, laid himself open to blame; the other generals, by imagining that the war was over, contrived a distinction for its closing scene. Even Petilius Cerialis, though he had been sent on with a thousand cavalry by cross roads through the Sabine district so as to enter Rome by the Via Salaria, had not been sufficiently prompt in his movements, when the report of the siege of the Capitol put all alike on the alert.[^5bdc6c76d2374c898473f5b1cb274af5]

Virgil departed from Ocriculum, intending to travel by road to Narnia, a 8.118212115 mile journey. 

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Narnia from Historiae



Finding all their hopes cut off, the troops of Vitellius, intending to pass over to the side of the conqueror, but to do so with honour, marched down with their standards and colours into the plains beneath Narnia. The army of Vespasian, prepared and equipped as if for action, was drawn up in dense array on both sides of the road. The Vitellianists were received between the two columns; when they were thus surrounded, Antonius addressed them kindly. One division was ordered to remain at Narnia, another at Interamna; with them were left some of the victorious legions, which would not be formidable to them if they remained quiet, but were strong enough to crush all turbulence. At the same time Primus and Varus did not neglect to forward continual messages to Vitellius, offering him personal safety, the enjoyment of wealth, and a quiet retreat in Campania, provided he would lay down his arms and surrender himself and his children to Vespasian. Mucianus also wrote to him to the same effect, and Vitellius was often disposed to trust these overtures, and even discussed the number of his household and the choice of a residence on the coast. Such a lethargy had come over his spirit, that, had not others remembered he had been an Emperor, he would have himself forgotten it.[^f8e70e82590c4373b5c7dffec88230a9]
