## Introduction
It has long been a common practice to incorporate the works of earlier writers into new books. Indeed, many commonplace books consist of nothing _but_ quotations and similar notes. We have many surviving examples from the Roman Empire, such as Aulus Gellius' _Attic Nights_. These texts were not always attributed to the original source. Lacking the modern concept of plagiarism (and our post-printing-press system of uniform citations) writers sometimes come off as careless to modern sensibilities. Quotes could be paraphrased and rather vague citations were the norm. Indeed, some authors committed a kind of reverse plagiarism, [pseudepigraphically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigrapha) attributing their work to an earlier, more famous author.
 
In a way, this reuse is fortunate: many texts from the Classical period only exist in fragments quoted in other documents. Some works survive in [epitome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome), distilled versions that summarized the text; for others we have fragments that later writers quoted or abridged as they wrote their compilations.

Artists, of course, have been far looser with their borrowings than writers of mere facts, placing the present work solidly within a long tradition. The closest literary ancedents of NaNoGenMo--Dada and Oulipo--have often explored similar sampling approaches. Kathryn Hume has suggested that technical constratints have lead NaNoGenMo to "align itself with poetics of recontextualization and reassembly." While I'd point out that NaNoGenMo also exhibits other aspects, such as the concrete poetry in thricedotted's _The Seeker_, or the way structurally-plotted works like _Hannah and The Twelve-Disk Tower of Hanoi_ evoke the chessboard constraints of _Life a User's Manual_ or _Through the Looking Glass_, there is an undeniable strand of appropreation as we teach our machines to imitate their human creators. Still, that's no reason to neglect giving credit, so this book attempts to cite the sources for the texts it borrows.

In this work, that deliberate borrowing is the intent. Unlike an age of precious codices, the information age is a time of entirely too much to read. Search engines can find anything you ask for but, like a fairy-tale mirror, can only answer the questions you know enough to ask in the first place. The serendipity of browsing through a library is lost. Extracting the stories and arranging them in a new pattern presents a new angle. Rather than an exhaustive view of the forest, it picks out one or two trees you might have otherwise overlooked.

I chose Virgil as the protagonist for three reasons: first, his works are among the source texts in the Perseus Digital Library used for much of the text here. His _Aeneid_ builds on earlier traditions, recast in a founding epic for a new age: appropriate for a work themed around appropriation and reuse in this new information age. This would not be enough to recommend him on its own: there are other authors whose works were much closer to the kind of copying and summarizing going on here. And _The Golden Ass_ by Apuleius, one of the earliest surviving novels, is closer in form to the travel tale that structures this generated novel. But there was also a tradition that linked Virgil and his poetry with magic and prophecy. It was no accident that Dante chose Virgil to be his guide through the _Inferno_. Lastly, that tradition of magic lead the much-neglected Avram Davidson to pen a novel with Vergil Magus as the magician-protagonist. My own pseudo-Virgil is a humble tribute, a machine homunculus librarian to forgotten texts.

### A story by Titus Livius (Livy) about Roma from The History of Rome, Book 1



There^[The Combat of the Horatii and Curiatii.] happened to be in each of the armies a triplet of brothers, fairly matched in years and strength. It is generally agreed that they were called Horatii and Curiatii. Few incidents in antiquity have been more widely celebrated, yet in spite of its celebrity there is a discrepancy in the accounts as to which nation each belonged. There are authorities on both sides, but I find that the majority give the name of Horatii to the Romans, and my sympathies lead me to follow them.

The kings suggested to them that they should each fight on behalf of their country, and where victory rested, there should be the sovereignty. They raised no objection; so the time and place were fixed. But before they engaged a treaty was concluded between the Romans and the Albans, providing that the nation whose representatives proved victorious should receive the peaceable submission of the other.

This is the earliest treaty recorded, and as all treaties, however different the conditions they contain, are concluded with the same forms, I will describe the forms with which this one was concluded as handed down by tradition. The Fetial put the formal question to Tullus: Do you, King, order me to make a treaty with the Pater Patratus of the Alban nation? On the king replying in the affirmative, the Fetial said: I demand of thee, King, some tufts of grass. The king replied: Take those that are pure. The Fetial brought pure grass from the Citadel. Then he asked the king: Do you constitute me the plenipotentiary of the People of Rome, the Quirites, sanctioning also my vessels and comrades? To which the king replied: So far as may be without hurt to myself and the People of Rome, the Quirites, I do. The Fetial was M. Valerius. He made Spurius Furius the Pater Patratus by touching his head and hair with the grass. Then the Pater Patratus, who is constituted for the purpose of giving the treaty the religious sanction of an oath, did so by a long formula in verse, which it is not worth while to quote. After reciting the conditions he said: Hear, 0 Jupiter, hear! thou Pater Patratus of the people of Alba! Hear ye, too, people of Alba! As these conditions have been publicly rehearsed from first to last, from these tablets, in perfect good faith, and inasmuch as they have here and now been most clearly understood, so these conditions the People of Rome will not be the first to go back from. If they shall, in their national council, with false and malicious intent be the first to go back, then do thou, Jupiter, on that day, so smite the People of Rome, even as I here and now shall smite this swine, and smite them so much the more heavily, as thou art greater in power and might. With these words he struck the swine with a flint. In similar wise the Albans recited their oath and formularies through their own dictator and their priests.[^93a6fa17226c499e86668411a493af57]

### A story by Polybius about Roma from Histories



It was in the nineteenth year after the sea-fight at^[B. C. 387-386. The rise of the Roman dominion may be traced from the retirement of the Gauls from the city. From that time one nation after another in Italy fell into their hands.] Aegospotami, and the sixteenth before the battle at Leuctra; the year in which the Lacedaemonians made what is called the Peace of Antalcidas with the King of Persia; the year in which the elder Dionysius was besieging Rhegium after beating the Italian Greeks on the river Elleporus; and in which the Gauls took Rome itself by storm and were occupying the whole of it except the Capitol. With these Gauls the Romans made a treaty and settlement which they were content to accept: and having thus become beyond all expectation once more masters of their own country, they made a start in their career of expansion; and in the succeeding period engaged in various wars with their neighbours.^[The Latini.] First, by dint of valour, and the good fortune which attended them in the field, they mastered all the Latini; then they went to war with the Etruscans; then with the Celts; and next with the Samnites, who lived on the eastern and northern frontiers of Latium.^[The Etruscans, Gauls, and Samnites.] Some time after this the Tarentines insulted the ambassadors of Rome, and, in fear of the consequences, invited and obtained the assistance of Pyrrhus.^[Pyrrhus, B. C. 280.] This happened in the year before the Gauls invaded Greece, some of whom perished near Delphi, while others crossed into Asia. Then it was that the Romans—having reduced the Etruscans and Samnites to obedience, and conquered the Italian Celts in many battles—attempted for the first time the reduction of the rest of Italy.^[Southern Italy.] The nations for whose possessions they were about to fight they affected to regard, not in the light of foreigners, but as already for the most part belonging and pertaining to themselves. The experience gained from their contests with the Samnites and the Celts had served as a genuine training in the art of war.^[Pyrrhus finally quits Italy, B. C. 274.] Accordingly, they entered upon the war with spirit, drove Pyrrhus from Italy, and then undertook to fight with and subdue those who had taken part with him. They succeeded everywhere to a marvel, and reduced to obedience all the tribes inhabiting Italy except the Celts; after which they undertook to besiege some of their own citizens, who at that time were occupying Rhegium.[^d85703ae44434f12a781ea45431b786f]

Virgil departed from Roma, intending to travel by road to Tibur, a 17.629538012 mile journey. 

### A story by Polybius about Tibur from Histories



After this one would naturally be inclined to ask what part is left for the people in the constitution, when the Senate has these various functions, especially the control of the receipts and expenditure of the exchequer; and when the Consuls, again, have absolute power over the details of military preparation, and an absolute authority in the field? There is, however, a part left the people, and it is a most important one. For the people is the sole fountain of honour and of punishment; and it is by these two things and these alone that dynasties and constitutions and, in a word, human society are held together: for where the distinction between them is not sharply drawn both in theory and practice, there no undertaking can be properly administered,—as indeed we might expect when good and bad are held in exactly the same honour. The people then are the only court to decide matters of life and death; and even in-cases where the penalty is money, if the sum to be assessed is sufficiently serious, and especially when the accused have held the higher magistracies. And in regard to this arrangement there is one point deserving especial commendation and record. Men who are on trial for their lives at Rome, while sentence is in process of being voted,—if even only one of the tribes whose votes are needed to ratify the sentence has not voted,—have the privilege at Rome of openly departing and condemning themselves to a voluntary exile. Such men are safe at Naples or Praeneste or at Tibur, and at other towns with which this arrangement has been duly ratified on oath.

Again, it is the people who bestow offices on the deserving, which are the most honourable rewards of virtue. It has also the absolute power of passing or repealing laws; and, most important of all, it is the people who deliberate on the question of peace or war. And when provisional terms are made for alliance, suspension of hostilities, or treaties, it is the people who ratify them or the reverse.

These considerations again would lead one to say that the chief power in the state was the people's, and that the constitution was a democracy.[^a19b927b8d114ae1ae9f533dd498a0f4]

### A story by Virgil about Tibur from Aeneid



A solemn custom was observ'd of old,  
Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,  
Their standard when in fighting fields they rear  
Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare  
The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;  
Or from the boasting Parthians would regain  
Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.  
Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,  
And still are worship'd with religious fear)  
Before his temple stand: the dire abode,  
And the fear'd issues of the furious god,  
Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,  
The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.  
Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,  
The Roman consul their decree declares,  
And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.  
The youth in military shouts arise,  
And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.  
These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,  
Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,  
Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar  
Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;  
But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,  
Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.  
Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:  
At her approach the brazen hinges fly;  
The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;  
And, like a tempest, issues out the war.  
  
The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,  
Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,  
Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,  
Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;  
Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,  
And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry.  
Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part  
New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:  
With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,  
And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.  
Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,  
Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,  
Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:  
All these of old were places of renown.  
Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;  
Some twine young sallows to support the shield;  
The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold,  
With silver plated, and with ductile gold.  
The rustic honors of the scythe and share  
Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.  
Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires;  
The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.  
The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace  
The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.  
The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;  
The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Tibur from Caligula



He completed the works which were left unfinished by Tiberius, namely, the temple of Augustus, and the theatre of Pompey.^[See TIBERIUS, c. xlvii. and AUGUSTUS, c. xxxi.] He began, likewise, the aqueduct from the neighbourhood of Tibur,^[This aqueduct, commenced by Caligula and completed by Claudian, a truly imperial work, conveyed the waters of two streams to Rome, following the valley of the Anio from above Tivoli. The course of one of these rivulets was forty miles, and it was carried on arches, immediately after quitting its source, for a distance of three miles. The other, the Anio Novus, also began on arches, which continued for upwards of twelve miles. After this, both were conveyed under ground; but at the distance of six miles from the city, they were united, and carried upon arches all the rest of the way. This is the most perfect of all the ancient aqueducts; and it has been repaired, so as to convey the Acqua Felice, one of the three streams which now supply Rome. See CLAUDIUS, c. XX. ] and an amphitheatre near the Septa;^[By Septa, Suetonius here means the huts or barracks of the pretorian camp, which was a permanent and fortified station. It stood to the east of the Viminal and Quirinal hills, between the present Porta Pia and S. Lorenzo, where these is a quadrangular projection in the city walls marking the site. The remains of the Amphitheatrum Castrense stand between the Porta Maggiore and S. Giovanni, formerly without the ancient walls, but now included in the line. It is all of brick, even the Corinthian pillars, and seems to have been but a rude structure, suited to the purpose for which it was built, the amusement of the soldiers, and gymnastic exercises. For this purpose they were used to construct temporary amphitheatres near the stations in the distant provinces, which were not built of stone or brick, but hollow circular spots dug in the ground, round which the spectators sat on the declivity, on ranges of seats cut in the sod. Many vestiges of this kind have been traced in Britain. ] of which works, one was completed by his successor Claudius, and the other remained as he left it. The walls of Syracuse, which had fallen to decay by length of time, he repaired, as he likewise did the temples of the gods. He formed plans for rebuilding the palace of Polycrates at Samos, finishing the temple of the Didymaean Apollo at Miletus, and building a town on a ridge of the Alps; but, above all, for cutting through the isthmus in Achaia^[The Isthmus of Corinth; an enterprize which had formerly been attempted by Demetrius, and which was also projected by Julius Caesar, c. xliv., and Nero, c. xix.; but they all failed of accomplishing it.] and even sent a centurion of the first rank to measure out the work.[^d1d1638bd611400a9c90bda3c0b43521]

Virgil departed from Tibur, intending to travel by road to Roma, a 17.629538012 mile journey. 

### A story by E. T. Merrill about Roma from Commentary on Catullus



The self-mutilation and subsequent lament of Attis, a priest of Cybele. The centre of the worship of the Phrygian Κυβέλη or Κυβήβη, was in very ancient times the town of Pessinus in Galatian Phrygia, at the foot of Mt. Dindymus, from which the goddess received the name Dindymene. Cybele had early become identified with the Cretan divinity Rhea, the Mother of the Gods, and to some extent with Demeter, the search of Cyhele for Attis being compared with that of Demeter for Persephone. The especial worship of Cybele was conducted by emasculated priests called Galli (or, as in vv. 12 and 34, with reference to their physical condition, Gallae). Their name was derived by the ancients from that of the river Gallus, a tributary of the Sangarius, by drinking from which men became inspired with frenzy (cf. Ov. Fast. 4.361ff.). The worship was orgiastic in the extreme, and was accompanied by the sound of such frenzy-producing instruments as the tympana, cymbala, tibiae, and cornu, and culminated in scourging, self-mutilation, syncope from excitement. and even death from hemorrhage or heart-failure (cf. Lucr. 2.598ff.; Varr. Sat. Men. 131 Büch.ff.; Ov. Fast. 4.179ff.). The worship of the Magna Mater, or Mater Idaea, as she was often called (perhaps from identification with Rhea of the Cretan Mt. Ida rather than from the Trojan Mt. Ida), was introduced into Rome in 205 B.C. in accordance with a Sibylline oracle which foretold that only so could 'a foreign enemy' (i.e. Hannibal) be driven from Italy. Livy 29.10, Livy 29.14) gives an interesting account of the solemnities that accompanied the transfer from Pessinus to Rome of the black stone that represented the divinity, and of the establishment of the Megalensia; cf. also Ov. Fast. 4.247ff. The stone itself was perhaps a meteorite, and is thus described by Arnobius Adu. Gent. 7.46: lapis quidam non magnus, ferri manu hominis sine ulla impressione qui posset; coloris furvi atque atri, angellis prominentibus inaequalis, et quem omnes hodie … videmus … indolatum et asperum. Servius (Aen. 7.188) speaks of it as acus Matris Deum, and as one of the seven objects on which depended the safety of Rome.

The early connection of Attis with the Mother of the Gods seems to point to the association of an original male element with an original female element as the parents of all things. But in the age of tradition Attis appears as a servant instead of an equal, and the subordination of the male to the female element is further emphasized by the representation of Attis, like the Galli of historic times, as an emasculated priest. Greek imagination pictured him as a beautiful youth who was beloved by the goddess, but wandered away from her and became untrue; but being sought and recalled to allegiance by her, in a passion of remorse he not only spent his life in her service, but by his own act made impossible for the future such infidelity on his part, thus setting the example followed by all the Galli after him (cf. Ovid Fast. l. c.). Catullus departs from this form of the Attis myth, and makes Attis a beautiful Greek youth who in a moment of religious frenzy sails across seas at the head of a band of companions to devote himself to the already long-established service of the goddess (vv. 1-3). On reaching the shores of Trojan Ida he consummates the irrevocable act of dedication (vv. 4-5), and with his companions rushes up the mountain to the sanctuary of the goddess (vv. 6-38). But on awaking next morning he feels the full awfulness of his act (vv. 39-47), and gazing out over the sea toward his lost home, bewails his fate (vv. 48-73), till the jealous goddess unyokes a lion from her car and sends him to drive her wavering votary back to his allegiance (vv. 74-fin.). The story is told with a nervous vigor and swing of feeling that are unequalled in Latin literature, and to it the galliambic meter (Intr. 85), the one traditionally appropriated to such themes, lends great effect. The date of composition is uncertain, but Catullus may have found his immediate inspiration in his contact with the Cybelian worship in its original home during his residence in Bithynia in 57-56 B.C. (see Intr. 29ff.). Or it may have been found in his studies in the Alexandrian poets; for Callimachus certainly used the galliambic meter, though no distinct title of a poem by him on this theme is extant. Caecilius of Comum was also engaged on a poem based on the worship of Cybele (cf. Catul. 35.13ff.), and Varro and Maecenas both exercised their talents in the same direction (cf. Varr. Sat. Men. l. c.; Maec. in Baehr. Bragm. Poet. Rom. p. 339).

The poem abounds in rhetorical devices to add to its effect; such are the frequent employment of alliteration (vv. 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, etc.), of strange and harsh compounds (vv. 23 hederigerae, 34 properipedem, 45 sonipedibus, 51 erifugae, 72 nemorivagus), and the repetition of words of agitated movement and feeling (eg. rapidus three times, citatus four times, citus twice, rabidus three times, rabies once).

celeri: indicating his eagerness for arrival.

Phrygium nemus: that clothing the slopes not of Dindymus but of Ida (cf. vv. 30, 52).

citato cupide pede: emphazing the eager haste of the traveller, rather than indicating a land journey after reaching the shores of Asia (cf. vv. 47, 89), the poet is not writing as a geographer. Cf. v. 30 properante pede.

opaca: cf. v. 32. The mad rush of the new devotees is contrasted with the silent mysteries of the abode of the goddess.

ibi: thereupon; cf. vv. 42, 48, 76; and Catul. 66.33; Catul. 8.6n.

furenti rabie: cf. v. 38 rabidus furor.

vagus animis: the plural to indicate his divided, distorted emotions; cf. Verg. A. 8.228 ecce furens animis aderat Tirynthius .

ili: genitive from the stem ilio-, a rare but legitimate variant for the more frequent ili-; cf. Cels. 4.1 iliis (dat. plur.); Gloss. Labb. ilium λαγών ; Marc. Emp. 36 [ilium] .

sine viro: i.e. sine virilitate.

terrae sola: (plural, as in v. 40 sola dura): cf. Lucr. 2.592 nam multis succensa locis ardent sola terrae.

niveis manibus: cf. v. 10 n. teneris digitis. Adjectives descriptive of feminine beauty are employed to accord with the change of gender under which Attis is now spoken of, and himself speaks of his companions (vv. 12 Gallae, 15 exsecutae, 34 rapidae Gallae); cf. Hor. Carm. 2.4.3 niveo colore (of Briseis); Hor. Carm. 3.27.25 niveum latus (of Europe); Verg. A. 8.387 niveis lacertis (of Venus).

citata: Attis is from henceforth a notha mulier (v. 27), and is described by feminine adjectives; cf. vv. 11 adorta, tremebunda, 31 furibunda, 32 comitata, etc.; but when he returns to himself and thinks with sorrow and loathing upon his condition, the masculine adjective is resumed; cf. vv. 51 miser, 78 hunc, 88 tenerum, 89 ille. The emendations by which all these later masculines (except v. 78 hunc) have been transformed to feminines are based on incorrect feeling.

lene: the tympanum is probably called leve because it is cavum (v. 10).

typanum: Gr. poet. form τύπανον metri gratia (cf. v. 21, etc. tympanum, Gr. τύμπανον); from representations in vase- and wall-paintings, an instrument like the modern tambourine, but with the rattling disks of metal suspended at intervals from its edge by short cords.

tubam Cybelles: as the blare of the tuba is the summons and incitement to warriors, so is the beat of the tympanum to the votaries of Cybele; the phrase is further explained by tua initia. The famous norm of Bentley (on Lucan 1.600) that when the penult is short, the form Cybele should be written, but when it is long the form Cybebe, Cybelle being discarded altogether, is not well supported by either Greek or Latin usage. Cybelle (Gr. *ku/bella) is found in many good MSS.

mater: Cybele was the Magna Mater Idaea of the Romans, as well as mater deorum; cf. intr. note; Hymn. Cyb. μήτερα μοι πάντων τε θεῶν, πάντων τ᾽ ἀνθρώπων .

initia: technically used only of the mysteries of Demeter (cf. Varr. RR 3.I.5 initia vocantur potissimum ea quae Cereri fiunt sacra ), but here of the symbol of the secret worship of Cybele, perhaps by reason of the popular confusion of Cybele with Demeter.

teneris digitis: cf. v. 8 n. niveis manibus; Ov. Ib. 456 [ut Attis] quatias molli tympana rauca manu ; Ov. Fast. 4.342 feriunt molles taurea terga manus.

cava: the word tympanum also denoted a kettle-drum with a hemispherical resounding cavity and a single head of hide, and so cava, which would properly characterize it, is here used of its cognate instrument, the tambourine; cf. Ov. Fast. 4.183 inania tympana tundent ; Aus. Epist. 29.21 cava tympana.

tremebunda: in the quivermg of nervous excitement.

agite: cf. Catul. 61.38n.

Gallae: cf. v. 34, and intr. note.

Cybeles: Gr. Κυβέλη; cf. v. 9 n. Cybelles.

Dindymenae dominae: cf. v. 91; Catul. 35.14.

vaga: of the purposeless wanderings of the crazed devotees; cf. vv. 18 erroribus; 25 vaga cohors; 31 vaga vadit.

pecora: cf. Ov. Ib. 457 pecus Magnae Parentis (of the Galli)

sectam meam exsecutae: under my rule; Attis acts as recruiting officer, and then (duce me) guides the new devotees to their place of service. comites implies here a certain subordination as in the case of the comites of a provincial governor; cf. Catul. 28.1 Catul. 11.1. Apparently exsequi is used with sectam only here, though Cicero uses sectam persequi (Cic. Verr. 2.5.70.181), and sectam sequi is frequently found (cf. Livy 29.27.2 qui meam sectam secuntur , a formal expression in an invocation).

rapidum: of the rushing waves of the sea, as explained in truculenta pelagi; cf. Catul. 64.358 rapido Hellesponto .

truculenta pelagi: with the construction cf. Verg. A. 9.81 pelagi alta ; Hor. Carm. 4.4.76 acuta belli ; with the sentiment, Hor. Carm. 1.3.10 truci pelago .

hilarate, etc.: i.e. haste to gladden the heart of the goddess by the presence of this new accession of enthusiastic votaries.

erroribus: the rabidus furor animi (v. 38) would lead the band, not directly to the temple, but in Maenad-like tortuousness of course.

cymbalum: cymbala were hollow hemispheres of metal a few inches in diameter, held one in each hand by the aid of small rings or thongs attached to the center of their convex surfaces. Struck together, they gave a sharp, clanging sound that fitted well with that of the tympana and tibiae; cf. Catul. 64.262 tereti tenuis tinnitus aere ciebant ; Ov. Fast. 4.184 aera tinnitus aere repulsa dabunt ; Ov. Fast. 4.189 sonus aeris acuti ; Aus. Epist. 24.23 tinnitus atinnitus aëni.eumlaut;ni.

reboant: cf. Aus. Epist. 24.21 tentis reboant cava tympana tergis .

Phryx: the tibiae were said to be a Phrygian invention; cf. Catul. 64.264; Lucr. 2.620 Phrygio stimulat numero cava tibia mentis ; Tib. 2.1.86 obstrepit et Phrygio tibia curva sono ; Ov. Fast. 4.181 inflexo Berecyntia tibia cornu .

curvo calamo: the tibia was originally made of a reed. The curved variety appears from bas-reliefs to have been shaped sometimes like the lituus, straight and of uniform diameter from the mouth-piece till near the bell, where it curved sharply back upon itself, but sometimes to have had a gentle double curve and an increasing diameter from mouthniece to bell, like a cow-horn. The straight varieties, more commonly used, were generally played in pairs, one with each hand, being often supported in position at the player's mouth by a band admitting the two mouth-pieces and fastened at the back of the head.

graue: cf. Stat. Theb. 6.113 signum luctus cornu grave mugit adunco tibia .

maenades: the poet borrows for the priests of Cybele the name appropriate to the frenzied maidens that attended upon the similar rites of Dionysus.

capita vi iaciunt: frequent wall-paintings and engraved gems show the bacchanals beating the tympana and swaying the head violently back and forth; cf. Catul. 64.255 capita inflectentes ; Maec. frag. 4 Baehr. sonante typano quate flexibile caput ; Varr. Sat. Men. 132 Buech. semiviri teretem comam volantem iactant ; Ov. Met. 3.726 ululavit Agave, collaque iactavit, movitque per aera crinem .

hederigerae: ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.

acutis ululatibus cf. v. 28 Maec. frag. 5 Baehr. comitum chorus ululet Ov. Fast. 4.341 exululant comites , Met. l. c.

illa: the demonstrative characterizes as well known the whole statement; in this use ille corresponds closely to our definite article.

volitare vaga: so of Bacchus in Catul. 64.251, Catul. 64.390.

cohors: i.e. comites; cf. v. 11 and 28.1 Pisonis comites, cohors inanis.

tripudiis: of the wild, rhythmic dance connected with the worship.

simul: sc. atque; cf. v. 45 and Catul. 22.15n.

notha mulier: cf. Ov. Fast. 4.183 semimares (of the Galli); Ov. Ib. 453 nec femina nec vir (of Attis); Varro Sat. Men. 132 Buech. semiviri (of the Galli).

thiasus: of a band of raving devotees, as in 64.252, and often, of the attendants of Iacchus.

trepidantibus: as v. 11 tremebunda, of the quivering of nervous excitement; cf. Verg. A. 7.395 aliae tremulis ululatibus aethera complent (of the Bacchic worshippers).

ululat: cf. v. 24 n. ululatibus.

leve tympanum: cf. v. 8 leve tympanum.

recrepant: the word apparently occurs only here and in Ciris 108 lapis recrepat Cyllenia murmura pulsus .

viridem Idam: cf. v. 70; Culex 311 iugis Ida patens frondentibus ; Ov. AA 1.289 sub umbrosis nemorosae vallibus Idae ; Ov. Fast. 6.327 in opacae vallibus Idae ; Ov. Met. 11.762 umbrosa sub Ida ; Stat. Silv. 3.4.12 pinifera Ida .

properante pede: cf. v. 34 properipedem.

animam agens: to be explained from anhelans of the almost fainting condition resulting from haste, excitement, and exhaustion, gasping. It usually means 'to give up the ghost'; cf. Cic. Fam. 8.13.2 Q. Hortensius, cum has litteras scripsi, animam agebat.

comitata: usually with an ablative of person instead of thing when, as here, it has a personal subject.

veluti iuvenca: etc. the comparison is usually employed by the poets of the yoke of love; cf. Catul. 68.118n.

domum Cybelles: apparently the shrine of the goddess on the mountain-top.

Cerere: cf. Cic. ND 2.23.60 fruges Cererem appellamus, vinum autem Liberum; ex quo illud Terenti 'sine Cerere et, Libero friget Venus' (from Ter. Eun. 732).—The fasting in this case was probably not due to a requirement of ritual, but simply to the utterly exhausted condition of the new Galli.

quiete molli: etc. cf. v. 44.

rabidus furor: cf. v. 4 furenti rabie.

oris aurei: doubtless to be construed with Sol rather than with oculis; cf. Lucr. 5.461 aurea … matutina rubent radiati lumina solis ; Verg. G. 1.232 sol aureus ; Ov. Met. 7.663 iubar aureus extulerat sol .

radiantibus oculis: cf. Ov. Trist. 2.325 radiantia lumina solis ; and with the figure in oculis, F. W. Bonrdillon, "the night has a thousand eyes and the day but one."

lustravit: surveyed, rather than 'illumined,' as the figure in oculis shows.

aethera album: etc. the adjectives album, dura, ferum describe permanent characteristics and not those peculiar to the morning, and hence album must be understood not merely of the sky brightened by dawn, but of the bright, fiery aether; cf. Cic. ND 1.13.33 caeli ardorem ; Cic. ND 2.15.41 in ardore caelesti qui aether vel caelum nominatur .

sola: plural, since the sun views every region of earth.

dura: solid, to distinguish the earth from the fluid aether and sea.

feram: a traditional epithet of the sea; cf. v. 16 n.

sonipedibus: first in Lucil. 15.15. Muel. Campanus sonipes ; also in Cic. De Or. 3.47.183 paeon … sicut … sonipedes ; and frequently in later poets.

ibi: temporal, as in v. 4 (see note).

Somnus: etc. the morn having come, Somnus is released from duty and flies eagerly (citus) back to Pasithea, whose reciprocal eagerness of longing is indicated by v. 43 trepidante sinu. Pasithea was one of the lesser Graces, and was promised to Sleep as a wife by Hera in Hom. Il. 14.267ff.

simul: cf. v. 27 n. simul.

liquida mente: of passionless calm; cf. Pl. Epid. 643 animo liquido et tranquillo's: tace! Pl. Ps. 232 nihil curassis: liquido's animo: ego pro me et pro te curabo .

sine quis: cf. v. 5.

ubique: the quantity of the penult shows the equivalence to et ubi.

animo aestuante: contrasted with liquida mente; there was but a moment of clear and calm mental vision succeeded by the torture of recollection.

rasum: so sometimes in earlier Latin (including Lucretius) for later rursus.

reditum tetulit: cf. v. 79 uti reditum ferat; Catul. 61.26 aditum ferens ; Catul. 61.43 aditum ferat. On the archaic form of the verb cf. v. 52; Catul. 34.8n.

maria vasta: cf. Catul. 31.3 mari vasto ; Catul. 64.127 pelagi vastos aestus .

miseriter: for misere, as puriter for pure in Catul. 39.14; Catul. 76.19.

miser: while under the influence of his mad enthusiasm, Attis gloried in his emasculation, but now, in his recovered senses, he speaks of his condition only with loathing, using feminines (v. 68) to point this feeling, but of course not using a feminine adjective in this expression of passionate longing for his home.

tetuli: see 34.8 n.

ferarum gelida stabula: cf. Verg. A. 6.179 itur in antiquam silvam, stabula alta ferarum . On the lengthening of the final syllable before initial st see Intr. 86g.

reor: indicative present with future meaning; cf Catul. 1.1n. dono.

pupula: cf. Cic. ND 2.57.142 acies ipsa, qua cernimus, quae pupula vocatur.

derigere: so, rather than dirigere, of the fixed gaze in a single direction; cf. Catul. 22.8 derecta plumbo .

carens est: for caret; cf. Catul. 64.317n. fuerant exstantia.

genitoribus: i.e. parentibus; cf. Lucr. 2.615 ingrati genitoribus (of the Galli).

foro: the poet here employs the corresponding Latin word for the Greek ἀγορά.

miser ah miser: cf. Catul. 61.139.

etiam atque etiam: cf. Pl. Trin. 674 te moneo hoc etiam atque etiam ; Ter. Eun. 56 etiam atque etiam cogita ; and often in later writers.

figurae: under the word is the Greek feeling for the beauty of the human form that had made Attis the object of so much adoration; cf. Cic. ND 1.18.47ff.

mulier: starting with the torturing thought of his present hateful condition, he retraces the steps of his former career as the passionate admiration of a whole city.

adulescens: cf. Catul. 12.9n. puer; Censor. Die Nat. 14.2 [Varro putat] usque annum XV. pueros dictos … ad tricensimum annum adulescentes … usque quinque et quadraginta annos iuvenis … adusque sexagensimum annum seniores … inde usque finem vitae senes .

ephebus: cf. Censor. Die Nat. 14.8 de tertia autem aetate adulescentulorum tres gradus esse factos in Graecia prius quam ad viros perveniatur, quod vocent annorum xiiii. παῖδα, μελλέφηβον autem xv., dein sedecim ἔφηβον,tunc septemdecim ἐξέφηβον.

gymnasi flos: with the figure cf. Catul. 17.14n.

olei: i.e. palaestrae, as the contestants were well rubbed with oil before the sports; cf. Cic. De Or. 1.18.81 nitidum … genus verborum … sed palaestrae … et olei.

ianuae frequentes: devoted admirers flocked to his doors by day.

limina tepida: finding no entrance, his lovers spent the night in complaints on his door-stone; cf. Plat. Symp. 183a οἱ ἐρασται … ποιούμενοι … κοιμήσεις ἐπι θύραις ; Aristaenetus 2.20 ὅτε μὲν γὰρ αὐτοὶ ποθεῖτε, ἀστρώτους καὶ χαμαιπετεῖς κοιμήσεις ἐπὶ θύραις ποιεῖσθε ; Hor. Carm. 3.10.20 non hoc semper erit liminis patiens latus , Prop. 1.16.22 tristis et in tepido limine somnus erit ; Ov. Met. 14.709 posuit in limine duro molle latus .

corollis: the door-posts and threshold were decorated with garlands by the lovers in token of their devotion; cf. Lucr. 4.1177 at lacrimans exclusus amator limina saepe floribus et sertis operit ; Ov. Met. 14.708 interdum madidas lacrimarum rore coronas postibus intendit ; Prop. 1.16.7 mihi non desunt turpes pendere corollae .

linquendum ubi: etc. the proudly careless boy affected so completely to disregard the attentions of his lovers as to be aware of them only as he left the house in the morning for the stadium and palaestra.

esset: only one earlier instance of the subjunctive of repetition with ubi can be cited (Pl. Bacch. 431). In the silver age the construction becomes more frequent; cf. Hor. Carm. 3.6.41 sol ubi montium mutaret umbras.

deum ministra: not specifically a servant of the general pantheon, but simply a temple servant, an unknown priest instead of the beloved of a city: the needful specification follows in Cybeles famula; cf. Tac. Ann. 1.10.5; Tac. Ann. 4.37.5 effigie numinum .

ministra, famula: not content with the contrast between the lord of a cityful of lovers and the slave of a mysterious divinity, Attis brands his present disgrace by using the feminine form.

maenas: cf. v. 23 n. maenades.

viridis Idae: cf. v. 30 n.

altis Phrygiae columinibus: the following verse makes it clear that mountain-summits are meant, though the form appears to be used only here in that sense; but the form culmen is so used by Caes. BG 3.2 and by Suet. Dom. 23, and perhaps columinibus is here used metri gratia.

silvicultrix, nemorivagus: each adjective is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, though Verg. A. 10.551 uses silvicola, and Lucr. 2.597 montivagum .

iam iam: with the repetition cf. Cic. Phil. 2 34.87 iam iam minime miror te otium perturbare ; Verg. A. 12.875 iam iam linquo acies .

iam iamque: not = et iam iam, for the passionate exclamation of sorrow demands an asyndeton; the phrase rather = iam et iam; cf. Cic. Att. 7.20.1 at illum ruere nuntiant et iam iamque adesee ; Cic. Att. 16.9 iam iamque video bellum : and in Catullus himself Catul. 38.3 and Catul. 64.274 magis magis beside Catul. 68.48 magis atque magis .

roseis labellis: the youthful beauty of Attis is thus contrasted with the intensity of his suffering and the bitterness of his plaint; cf. Catul. 45.12n. purpureo ore.

geminas: cf. Catul. 51.11 gemina teguntur lumina nocte (where, however, there is a transfer of epithet); Culex 150 geminas aures ; Verg. A. 5.416 temporibus geminis ; Ov. Fast. 2.154 geminos pedes ; Stat. Silv. 4.4.26 geminas aures ; Mart. 10.10.10 geminas manus .

deorum aures: somewhat loosely said, as if Cybele were not alone on the summit of Ida, but in the company of the other gods.

nuntia: the neuter singular in the sense of 'news' is very unusual, and the neuter plural in the same sense is still more rare; cf. however Sedul. 2.474 grandia nuntia .

iuga resolvens: while unfastening the lion from the yoke she addresses him. Cybele is often depicted by the poets as riding in a chariot drawn by yoked lions; cf. Lucr. 2.600 hanc veteres Graium docti cecinere poetae sedibus in curru biiugos agitare Ieones ; Verg. A. 3.113 et iuncti currum dominae subiere Ieones ; Verg. A. 10.253 biiugi ad frena leones.

laevum: the 'nigh' lion; the specification is doubtless introduced for the sake of increasing the realistic effect of the lion's attack by details of word painting.

pecoris hostem: probably with reference to the Greek descriptions of the lion as ταυροβόρος (Anth. Plan. 94), ταυροκτόνος (Soph. Phil. 400), ταυρολέτωρ (Man. Chron. 252), ταυροσφάγος (Lyc. 47), ταυροφόνος (Orph. Hym. 14.2); for pecus indicates neat cattle as well as sheep; cf. Varro RR 2.1.12 de pecore maiore, in quo sunt … boues, asini, equi .

stimulans: probably not with a goad, but with her words.

agedum, age: with the repetition cf. Ter. And. 310 age age .

fac ut: with the construction cf. v. 79 Catul. 64.231; Catul. 109.3; but for fac and subjunctive without ut, v. 82; Catul. 68.46.

reditum ferat: cf. v. 47 reditum tetulit.

caede terga cauda: this habit of the lion in rage is noted by Plin. NH 8.16.49, and by Luc. Phar. 1.208 mox ubi se saevae stimulavit verbere caudae erexitque iubam et vasto grave murmur hiatu infremuit .

fac retonent: with the construction cf. Catul. 68.46 and v. 78 n. retonent is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.

minax: of Cybele's attitude toward Attis.

religat iuga: frees the lion from the yoke, completing the action begun in v. 76 iuncta iaga resolvens; with this conjunction of resolvere and religare in the same meaning cf. Pallad. Rut. 3.13 providendum est omnibus annis vitem resolvi ac religari . For religare in the other sense cf. Catul. 64.174.

rabidum: Cybele's exhortation was to arouse the lion to fury rather than to haste, and that is the characteristic passion of his subsequent action; hence rapidum, the reading of V, must be an error for rabidum, as rapidos for rabidos in v. 93, where a similar collocation occurs, incitatos rabidos being like rabidum incitat.

pede vago: the lion rushes now here, now there, in search of his prey; otherwise in Catul. 64.277.

albicantis: not of the general color of sea-sand, but of the whiteness and sparkle of a foamwet beach, as the position and use of umida indicate.

loca litoris: cf. v. 70 Idae loca.

tenerum: not of the beauty, but of the present effeminate condition of Attis; cf. Juv. 1.22 tener spado .

marmora pelagi: cf. Hom. Il. 14.273 ἅλα μαρμαρέην . The word seems to describe the sparkling of the sea that occurs when it is covered with ripples only, and hence to convey the idea of a calm expanse (nitens aequor).

demens: sc. with present fear, not with past recollections.

famula: repeating the feminine used by Attis himself in v. 68, and leaving with the reader, as the final thought, the irrevocable character of the awful self-consecration with which the poem opened.

The epilogue is a brief hymn to the dread goddess herself.

dea magna: cf. Prop. 4.17.35 dea magna Cybelle .

domina Dindymi: cf. v. 13; Catul. 35.14.

procul: etc. cf. Ov. Fast. 4.116 a nobis sit furor iste procul .

age: with the verb in this sense with an adjective expressing, as it were, the result of the action, cf. Ov. Met. 5.13 quae te, germane, furentem mens agit in facinus? Tac. Agr. 41 sic Agricola … in ipsam gloriam praeceps agebatur.

incitatos … rabidos; cf. the same collocation in v. 85 rabidum incitat.[^0861ea8c67a247deafbb5ad59c616a7f]

Virgil departed from Roma, intending to travel by road to Tibur, a 17.629538012 mile journey. 

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Tibur from Philippics



Marcus Lepidus is desirous of peace. He does well especially if he can make such a peace as he made lately, owing to which the republic will behold the son of Cnaeus Pompeius, and will receive him in her bosom and embrace; and will think, that not he alone, but that she also is restored to herself with him. This was the reason why you decreed to him a statue in the rostra with an honorable inscription, and why you voted him a triumph in his absence. For although he had performed great exploits in war, and such as well deserved a triumph, still for that he might not have had that given to him which was not given to Lucius Aemilius, nor to Aemilianus Scipio, nor to the former Africanus, nor to Marius, nor to Pompeius, who had the conduct of greater wars than he had, but because he had put an end to a civil war in perfect silence, the first moment that it was in his power, on that account you conferred on him the greatest honors.[^ae1853bf969f4640bf04aeddaea15260]

### A story by Julius Caesar about Corfinium from Civil War



Pompey, having intelligence of what passed at Corfinium, retreated from Luceria to Canusium, and from thence to Brundusium. He ordered all the new levies to join him, armed the shepherds and slaves, furnished them with horses, and formed a body of about three hundred cavalry. Meanwhile the pretor L. Manlius flying from Alba, with six cohorts; and the pretor Rutilus Lupus, from Tarracina, with three; saw Caesar's cavalry at a distance, commanded by Bivius Curius: upon which, the soldiers immediately abandoned the two pretors, and joined the troops under the conduct of Curius. Several other parties, flying different ways, fell in, some with the foot,otherswith the horse. Cn. Magius of Cremona, Pompey's chief engineer, being taken on his way to Brundusium, was brought to Caesar, who sent him back to Pompey with this message: "That as he had not yet obtained an interview, his design was to come to Brundusium, there to confer with him in relation to the common safety; because they soon would be able to despatch, in a personal treaty, what, if managed by the intervention of others, could not be hindered from running into a tedious negotiation."[^0054813f643741e2b649e43f2eb61e9e]

### A story by Julius Caesar about Corfinium from Civil War



Caesar having made himself master of Asculum, and obliged Lentulus to retire, ordered the soldiers who had deserted him, to be sought after, and new levies to be made. He remained only one day there, to settle what related to provisions, and then pursued his march to Corfinium. Upon his arrival there, he found five cohorts, whom Domitius had detached from the garrison, employed in breaking down a bridge about three miles distant from the town. But Caesar's advanced parties attacking them, they quickly abandoned the bridge, and retired to Corfinium. Caesar having passed with his legions, halted before the town, and encamped under the walls.[^af34af90e69543479832832e7b766c11]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Bovianum from For Aulus Cluentius



Oppianicus began to entreat the man to show him some method of corrupting the tribunal But he, as was afterwards heard from Oppianicus himself, said that there was no one in the city except himself who could do this. But at first he began to make objections, because he said that he was a candidate for the aedileship with men of the highest rank, and that he was afraid of incurring unpopularity and of giving offence. Afterwards, being prevailed on, he required at first a large sum of money. At last, he came down to what could be managed, and desired six hundred and forty thousand sesterces to be sent to his house. And as soon as this money was brought to him, that most worthless man immediately began to form and adopt the following idea,—that nothing could be more advantageous for his interests than for Oppianicus to be condemned; because, if he were acquitted, he must either distribute the money among the judges, or else restore it to him: but if he were condemned, there would be no one to reclaim it.[^5c26b5a56d1e43e1896c66abfa19e8b8]

### A story by Horace about Tibur from Odes



Come down, Calliope, from above:  
Breathe on the pipe a strain of fire:  
Or if a graver note thou love,  
With Phoebus' cittern and his lyre.  
You hear her? or is this the play  
Of fond illusion? Hark! meseems  
Through gardens of the good I stray,  
'Mid murmuring gales and purling streams.  
Me, as I lay on Vultur's steep,  
A truant past Apulia's bound,  
O'ertired, poor child, with play and sleep,  
With living green the stock-doves crown'd—  
A legend, nay, a miracle,  
By Acherontia's nestlings told,  
By all in Bantine glade that dwell,  
Or till the rich Forentan mould.  
"Bears, vipers, spared him as he lay,  
The sacred garland deck'd his hair,  
The myrtle blended with the bay:  
The child's inspired: the gods were there."  
Your grace, sweet Muses, shields me still  
On Sabine heights, or lets me range  
Where cool Praeneste, Tibur's hill,  
Or liquid Baiae proffers change.  
Me to your springs, your dances true,  
Philippi bore not to the ground,  
Nor the doom'd tree in falling slew,  
Nor billowy Palinurus drown'd.  
Grant me your presence, blithe and fain  
Mad Bosporus shall my bark explore;  
My foot shall tread the sandy plain  
That glows beside Assyria's shore;  
'Mid Briton tribes, the stranger's foe,  
And Spaniards, drunk with horses' blood,  
And quiver'd Scythians, will I go  
Unharm'd, and look on Tanais' flood.  
When Caesar's self in peaceful town  
The weary veteran's home has made,  
You bid him lay his helmet down  
And rest in your Pierian shade.  
Mild thoughts you plant, and joy to see  
Mild thoughts take root. The nations know  
How with descending thunder he  
The impious Titans hurl'd below,  
Who rules dull earth and stormy seas,  
And towns of men, and realms of pain,  
And gods, and mortal companies,  
Alone, impartial in his reign.  
Yet Jove had fear'd the giant rush,  
Their upraised arms, their port of pride,  
And the twin brethren bent to push  
Huge Pelion up Olympus' side.  
But Typhon, Mimas, what could these,  
Or what Porphyrion's stalwart scorn,  
Rhoetus, or he whose spears were trees,  
Enceladus, from earth uptorn,  
As on they rush'd in mad career  
'Gainst Pallas' shield? Here met the foe  
Fierce Vulcan, queenly Juno here,  
And he who ne'er shall quit his bow,  
Who laves in clear Castalian flood  
His locks, and loves the leafy growth  
Of Lycia next his native wood,  
The Delian and the Pataran both.  
Strength, mindless, falls by its own weight;  
Strength, mix'd with mind, is made more strong  
By the just gods, who surely hate  
The strength whose thoughts are set on wrong.  
Let hundred-handed Gyas bear  
His witness, and Orion known  
Tempter of Dian, chaste and fair,  
By Dian's maiden dart o'erthrown.  
Hurl'd on the monstrous shapes she bred,  
Earth groans, and mourns her children thrust  
To Orcus; Aetna's weight of lead  
Keeps down the fire that breaks its crust;  
Still sits the bird on Tityos' breast,

### A story by Titus Livius (Livy) about Roma from The History of Rome, Book 1



There^[Numa Pompilius elected King.] was living, in those days, at Cures, a Sabine city, a man of renowned justice and piety-Numa Pompilius. He was as conversant as any one in that age could be with all divine and human law. His master is given as Pythagoras of Samos, as tradition speaks of no other. But this is erroneous, for it is generally agreed that it was more than a century later, in the reign of Servius Tullius, that Pythagoras gathered round him crowds of eager students, in the most distant part of Italy, in the neighbourhood of Metapontum, Heraclea, and Crotona. Now, even if he had been contemporary with Numa, how could his reputation have reached the Sabines? From what places, and in what common language could he have induced any one to become his disciple? Who could have guaranteed the safety of a solitary individual travelling through so many nations differing in speech and character? I believe rather that Numa's virtues were the result of his native temperament and self-training, moulded not so much by foreign influences as by the rigorous and austere discipline of the ancient Sabines, which was the purest type of any that existed in the old days.

When Numa's name was mentioned, though the Roman senators saw that the balance of power would be on the side of the Sabines if the king were chosen from amongst them, still no one ventured to propose a partisan of his own, or any senator, or citizen in preference to him. Accordingly they all to a man decreed that the crown should be offered to Numa Pompilius. He was invited to Rome, and following the precedent set by Romulus, when he obtained his crown through the augury which sanctioned the founding of the City, Numa ordered that in his case also the gods should be consulted. He was solemnly conducted by an augur, who was afterwards honoured by being made a State functionary for life, to the Citadel, and took his seat on a stone facing south. The augur seated himself on his left hand, with his head covered, and holding in his right hand a curved staff without any knots, which they called a lituus. After surveying the prospect over the City and surrounding country, he offered prayers and marked out the heavenly regions by an imaginary line from east to west; the southern he defined as the right hand, the northern as the left hand. He then fixed upon an object, as far as he could see, as a corresponding mark, and then transferring the lituus to his left hand, he laid his right upon Numa's head and offered this prayer: Father Jupiter, if it be heaven's will that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be king of Rome, do thou signify it to us by sure signs within those boundaries which I have traced. Then he described in the usual formula the augury which he desired should be sent. They were sent, and Numa being by them manifested to be king, came down from the templum.^[templum —In taking auspices, the augur or magistrate marked out a rectangular space by noting certain objects, trees or what not, within which the desired signs were to appear, and tracing a corresponding area mentally in the sky. The spot where he took his station, the auguraculum, was also a small rectangular space; each of these was called a templum. All important magisterial acts were preceded by auspices, and the word templum was extended to denote the position occupied by the magistrate, such as the senate-house, the platform from which the Assembly was addressed, etc.][^320548e9075c4142af68adddbda7ae67]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Ostia/Portus from For Sestius



But that, forsooth, did seem like a fortune appointed for the republic by fate itself, that that blind and senseless tribune of the people should find two—must I call them consuls? must I honour by this name the overthrowers of this empire, the betrayers of your dignity, the enemies of all good men? men who thought that they had been adorned with those fasces, and with all the other insignia of supreme honour and command, for the purpose of destroying the senate, of crushing the equestrian order, and extinguishing all the rights and established principles of our ancestors. And, I beg you in the name of the immortal gods, if you do not yet wish to recall their wickedness and the wounds which they have burnt into the republic, still turn your recollection to their countenances and their gait. Their actions will more easily present themselves to your minds if you bring their faces before your eyes.[^5c24d71dddf1496cb1f844ff793d7127]

as they live in an island remote from any people to corrupt them. Also the remedy which they employ for this defect^[i.e. the defect of the undue restriction of the office.] is a curious one, and less characteristic of a republic than of a dynasty^[See 1292b 10 n.]: often the Cosmi are expelled by a conspiracy formed among some of their actual colleagues or the private citizens. Also the Cosmi are allowed to resign during their term of office. Now it would be preferable for all these expedients to be put in force by law rather than at the discretion of individuals, for that is a dangerous principle. And the worst expedient of all is that of the suspension of the office of Cosmi, which is often brought about by members of the powerful class who wish to escape being punished; this proves that the constitution has a republican element, although it is not actually a republic but rather a dynasty.^[See 1292b 10 n.] And the nobles frequently form parties among the common people and among their friends and so bring about a suspension of government,^[The MSS. give 'bring about a monarchy.'] and form factions and engage in war with one another. Yet such a state of things is virtually the same as if for a period of time the state underwent an entire revolution, and the bonds of civil society were loosened.And it is a precarious position for a state to be in, when those who wish to attack it also have the power to do so. But, as has been said, it is saved by its locality; for distance has had the same effect as alien-acts.^[Aliens required special permission to reside at Sparta, and the ephors had powers to expel them for undesirable conduct.] A result of this is that with the Cretans the serf population stands firm, whereas the Helots often revolt; for the Cretanstake no part in foreign empire, and also the island has only lately been invaded by warfare from abroad, rendering manifest the weakness of the legal system there.Let this suffice for our discussion of this form of constitution.Carthage also appears to have a good constitution, with many outstanding features as compared with those of other nations, but most nearly resembling the Spartan in some points. For these three constitutions are in a way near to one another and are widely different from the others—the Cretan, the Spartan and, thirdly, that of Carthage. Many regulations at Carthage are good; and a proof of a well-regulated constitution is that the populace willingly remain faithful to the constitutional system, and that neither civil strife has arisen in any degree worth mentioning, nor yet a tyrant.Points in which the Carthaginian constitution resembles the Spartan are the common mess-tables of its Comradeships corresponding to the Phiditia, and the magistracy of the Hundred and Four corresponding to the Ephors (except one point of superiority—the Ephors are drawn from any class, but the Carthaginians elect this magistracy by merit); the kings and the council of Elders correspond to the kings and Elders at Sparta, and it is another superior feature that the Carthaginian kings are not confined to the same family and that one of no particular distinction, and also that if any family distinguishes itself . . .^[Clauses seem to have been lost concluding the account of the appointment of the Kings and turning to the Elders and their selection on grounds of wealth.] the Elders are to be chosen from these rather than by age; for as they are put in control of important matters, if they are men of no value they do great harm,[^d04dcafce0c04759b202484ca697aad7]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Sabratha from Divus Vespasianus



Meanwhile, he married Flavia Domitilla, who had formerly been the mistress of Statilius Capella, a Roman knight of Sabrata in Africa, who [Domitilla] enjoyed Latin rights; and was soon after declared fully and freely a citizen of Rome, on a trial before the court of Recovery, brought by her father Flavius Liberalis, a native of Ferentum, but no more than secretary to a quaestor. By her he had the following children: Titus, Domitia nd Domitilla. He outlived his wife and daughter, and lost them both before he became emperor. After the death of his wife he renewed his union^["Revocavit in contubernium." From the difference of our habits, there is no word in the English language which exactly conveys the meaning of contubernium; a word which, in a military sense, the Romans applied to the intimate fellowship between comrades in war who messed together, and lived in close fellowship in the same tent. Thence they transferred it to a union with one woman who was in a higher position than a concubine, but, for some reason, could not acquire the legal rights of a wife, as in the case of slaves of either sex. A man of rank, also, could not marry a slave or a freedwoman, however much he might be attached to her.] with his former concubine, Caenis, the freedwoman of Antonia, and also her amanuensis, and treated her, even after he was emperor, almost as if she had been his lawful wife.^[Nearly the same phrases. are applied by Suetonius to Drusilla, see CALIGULA, c. xxiv., and to Marcella, the concubine of Commodus, by Herodian, 1. xvi. 9 , where he says that she had all the honours of an empress, except that the incense was not offered to her. These connections resembled the left-hand marriages of the German princes.][^418e387f06b1413588c27db01cefc947]

Virgil departed from Sabratha, intending to travel by ship, down the coast to Oea, a 47.362140362 mile journey. 

### A story by Apollodorus about Oea from Epitome



Ulysses, as some say, wandered about Libya, or, as some say, about Sicily, or, as others say, about the ocean or about the Tyrrhenian Sea.

And putting to sea from Ilium, he touched at Ismarus, a city of the Cicones, and captured it in war, and pillaged it, sparing Maro alone, who was priest of Apollo.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses with the Cicones, see Hom. Od. 9.39-66. The Cicones were a Thracian tribe; Xerxes and his army marched through their country (Hdt. 7.110). As to Maro, the priest of Apollo at Ismarus, see Hom. Od. 9.196-211. He dwelt in a wooded grove of Apollo, and bestowed splendid presents and twelve jars of red honey-sweet wine, in return for the protection which he and his wife received at the hands of Ulysses.] And when the Cicones who inhabited the mainland heard of it, they came in arms to withstand him, and having lost six men from each ship he put to sea and fled. And he landed in the country of the Lotus-eaters,^[As to the adventures of Ulysses with the Lotus-eaters, see Hom. Od. 9.82-104; Hyginus, Fab. 125. The Lotus-eaters were a tribe of northern Africa, inhabiting the coast of Tripolis (Scylax, Periplus 110; Pliny, Nat. Hist. v.28). As to the lotus, see Hdt. 4.177; Polybius xii.2.1, quoted by Athenaeus xiv.65, p. 651 DF; Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. iv.3.1ff. The tree is the Zizyphus Lotus of the botanists. Theophrastus says that the tree was common in Libya, that is, in northern Africa, and that an army marching on Carthage subsisted on its fruit alone for several days. The modern name of the tree is ssodr or ssidr. A whole district in Tripolis is named Ssodria after it. See A. Wiedemann, Herodots Zweites Buch, p. 385, note on Herodotus, ii.96.] and sent some to learn who inhabited it, but they tasted of the lotus and remained there; for there grew in the country a sweet fruit called lotus, which caused him who tasted it to forget everything. When Ulysses was informed of this, he restrained the rest of his men, and dragged those who had tasted the lotus by force to the ships. And having sailed to the land of the Cyclopes, he stood in for the shore.

And having left the rest of the ships in the neighboring island, he stood in for the land of the Cyclopes with a single ship, and landed with twelve companions.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses and his companions among the Cyclopes, see Hom. Od. 9.105-542; Hyginus, Fab. 125. The story is a folk-tale found in many lands. See Frazer's Appendix to Apollodorus, "Ulysses and Polyphemus."] And near the sea was a cave which he entered, taking with him the skin of wine that had been given him by Maro. Now the cave belonged to Polyphemus, who was a son of Poseidon and the nymph Thoosa, a huge, wild, cannibal man, with one eye on his forehead. And having lit a fire and sacrificed some of the kids, they feasted. But the Cyclops came, and when he had driven in his flocks, he put a huge stone to the door, and perceiving the men he ate some of them. But Ulysses gave him of Maro's wine to drink, and when he had drunk, he asked for another draught, and when he had drunk the second, he inquired his name; and when Ulysses said that he was called Nobody, he threatened to devour Nobody last and the others first, and that was the token of friendship which he promised to give him in return. And being overcome by wine, he fell asleep. But Ulysses found a club lying there, and with the help of four comrades he sharpened it, and, having heated it in the fire, he blinded him. And when Polyphemus cried to the Cyclopes round about for help, they came and asked who was hurting him, and when he said, " Nobody," they thought he meant that he was being hurt by nobody, and so they retired. And when the flocks sought their usual pasture, he opened the cave, and standing at the doorway spread out his hands and felt the sheep. But Ulysses tied three rams together,and himself getting under the bigger, and hiding under its belly, he passed out with the sheep. And having released his comrades from the sheep, he drove the animals to the ships, and sailing away shouted to the Cyclops that he was Ulysses and that he had escaped out of his hands. Now the Cyclops had been forewarned by a soothsayer that he should be blinded by Ulysses; and when he learned the name, he tore away rocks and hurled them into the sea, and hardly did the ship evade the rocks. From that time Poseidon was wroth with Ulysses.

Having put to sea with all his ships, he came to the island of Aeolia, of which the king was Aeolus.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses with Aeolus, the Keeper of the Winds, see Hom. Od. 10.1-76; Hyginus, Fab. 125; Ov. Met. 14.223-232.] He was appointed by Zeus keeper of the winds, both to calm them and to send them forth. Having entertained Ulysses, he gave him an oxhide bag in which he had bound fast the winds, after showing what winds to use on the voyage and binding fast the bag in the vessel. And by using suitable winds Ulysses had a prosperous voyage; and when he was near Ithaca and already saw the smoke rising from the town,^[Homer says (Hom. Od. 10.30) they were so near land that they could already see the men tending the fires (πυρπολέοντας); but whether the fires were signals to guide the ship to port, or watchfires of shepherds tending their flocks on the hills, does not appear.] he fell asleep. But his comrades, thinking he carried gold in the bag, loosed it and let the winds go free, and being swept away by the blasts they were driven back again. And having come to Aeolus, Ulysses begged that he might be granted a fair wind; but Aeolus drove him from the island, saying that he could not save him when the gods opposed.

So sailing on he came to the land of the Laestrygones,^[As to the adventures of Ulysses and his comrades among the Laestrygones, see Hom. Od. 10.80-132; Hyginus, Fab. 125; Ov. Met. 14.233-244.] andhis own ship he moored last. Now the Laestrygones were cannibals, and their king was Antiphates. Wishing, therefore, to learn about the inhabitants, Ulysses sent some men to inquire. But the king's daughter met them and led them to her father. And he snatched up one of them and devoured him; but the rest fled, and he pursued them, shouting and calling together the rest of the Laestrygones. They came to the sea, and by throwing stones they broke the vessels and ate the men. Ulysses cut the cable of his ship and put to sea; but the rest of the ships perished with their crews.

With one ship he put in to the Aeaean isle. It was inhabited by Circe, a daughter of the Sun and of Perse, and a sister of Aeetes; skilled in all enchantments was she.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses and his comrades with the enchantress Circe, see Hom. Od. 10.133-574; Hyginus, Fab. 125; Ov. Met. 14.246-440. The word (φάρμακα) here translated "enchantments" means primarily drugs; but in the early stages of medicine drugs were supposed to be endowed with magical potency, partly in virtue of the spells, that is, the form of words, with which the medical practitioner administered them to the patient. Hence druggist and enchanter were nearly synonymous terms. As Circe used her knowledge of drugs purely for magical purposes, without any regard to the medical side of the profession, it seems better to translate her φάρμακα by "enchantments" or "charms" rather than "drugs," and to call her an enchantress instead of a druggist.] Having divided his comrades, Ulysses himself abode by the ship, in accordance with the lot, but Eurylochus with two and twenty comrades repaired to Circe. At her call they all entered except Eurylochus; and to each she gave a tankard she had filled with cheese and honey and barley meal and wine, and mixed with an enchantment. And when they had drunk, she touched them with a wand and changed their shapes, and some she made wolves, and some swine, and some asses, and some lions.^[In Hom. Od. 10.237ff.) the companions of Ulysses are turned into swine only; nothing is said about a transformation of them into wolves, lions, and asses, though round about the house of the enchantress they saw wolves and lions, which stood on their hind legs, wagged their tails, and fawned upon them, because they were men enchanted (Hom. Od. 10.210-219).] But Eurylochus saw these things and reported them to Ulysses. And Ulysses went to Circe with moly,^[As to moly, see Hom. Od. 10.302-306. Homer says that it was a plant dug up from the earth, with a black root and a white flower. According to Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. ix.15.7, moly resembled Allium nigrum, which was found in the valley of Pheneus and on Mount Cyllene in northern Arcadia; he says it had a round root, like an onion, and a leaf like a squill, and that it was used as an antidote to spells and enchantments. But probably the moly of Homer grew on no earthly hill or valley, but only in "fairyland forlorn."] which he had received from Hermes, and throwing the moly among her enchantments, he drank and alone was not enchanted. Then drawing his sword, he would have killed her, but she appeased his wrath and restored his comrades. And when he had taken an oath of her that he should suffer no harm, Ulysses shared her bed, and a son, Telegonus, was born to him.^[Telegonus is unknown to Homer, who mentions no offspring of Ulysses by the enchantress Circe. He is named as a son of Ulysses and Circe by Hesiod in a line which is suspected, however, of being spurious (Hes. Th. 1014). He was recognized by Hagias in his epic, The Returns, and by another Cyclic poet Eugammon of Cyrene; indeed Eugammon composed an epic called the Telegony on the adventures of Telegonus, but according to him Telegonus was a son of Ulysses by Calypso, not by Circe. See Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta, ed. G. Kinkel, pp. 56, 57ff.; Eustathius on Hom. Od. xvi.118, p. 1796. According to Hyginus, Fab. 125, Ulysses had two sons, Nausithous and Telegonus, by Circe. As to Telegonus, see also below, Apollod. E.7.36ff.] Having tarried a year there, he sailed the ocean, and offered sacrifices to the souls,^[The visit of Ulysses to the land of the dead is the theme of the eleventh book of the Odyssey. Compare Hyginus, Fab. 125. The visit was the subject of one of the two great pictures by Polygnotus at Delphi. See Paus. 10.28-31.] and by Circe's advice consulted the soothsayer Tiresias,^[As to the consultation with Tiresias, see Hom. Od. 11.90-151.] and beheld the souls both of heroes and of heroines. He also looked on his mother Anticlia^[As to the interview of Ulysses with his mother, see Hom. Od. 11.153-224.] and Elpenor, who had died of a fall in the house of Circe.^[In the hot air of Circe's enchanted isle Elpenor had slept for coolness on the roof of the palace; then, suddenly wakened by the noise and bustle of his comrades making ready to depart, he started up and, forgetting to descend by the ladder, tumbled from the roof and broke his neck. In his hurry to be off, Ulysses had not stayed to bury his dead comrade; so the soul of Elpenor, unwept and unburied, was the first to meet his captain on the threshold of the spirit land. See Hom. Od. 10.552-560; Hom. Od. 11.51-83.]

And having come to Circe he was sent on his way by her, and put to sea, and sailed past the isle of the Sirens.^[As to the return of Ulysses to the isle of Circe, and his sailing past the Sirens, see Hom. Od. 12.1-200; Hyginus, Fab. 125. Homer does not name the Sirens individually nor mention their parentage, but by using the dual in reference to them (Hom. Od. 12.52; Hom. Od. 12.167) he indicates that they were two in number. Sophocles, in his play Ulysses, called the Sirens daughters of Phorcus, and agreed with Homer in recognizing only two of them. See Plut. Quaest. Conviv. ix.14.6; The Fragments of Sophocles, ed. A. C. Pearson, iii.66, frag. 861. Apollonius Rhodius says that the Muse Terpsichore bore the Sirens to Achelous (Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.895ff.). Hyginus names four of them, Teles, Raidne, Molpe, and Thelxiope (Hyginus, Fab. praefat. p. 30, ed. Bunte), and, in agreement with Apollodorus, says that they were the offspring of Achelous by the Muse Melpomene. Tzetzes calls them Parthenope, Leucosia, and Ligia, but adds that other people named them Pisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepia, and that they were the children of Achelous and Terpsichore. With regard to the parts which they took in the bewitching concert, he agrees with Apollodorus. See Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 712. According to a Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon.iv.892, their names were Thelxiope, or Thelxione, Molpe, and Aglaophonus. As to their names and parents see also Eustathius on Hom. Od. 12. p. 1709, Scholiast on Hom. Od. xii.39, who mention the view that the father of the Sirens was Achelous, and that their mother was either the Muse Terpsichore, or Sterope, daughter of Porthaon.] Now the Sirens were Pisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepia, daughters of Achelous and Melpomene, one of the Muses. One of them played the lyre, another sang, and another played the flute, and by these means they were fain to persuade passing mariners to linger; and from the thighs they had the forms of birds.^[Similarly Apollonius Rhodius (Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.898ff.) describes the Sirens as partly virgins and partly birds. Aelian tells us (Ael., Nat. Anim. xvii.23) that poets and painters represented them as winged maidens with the feet of birds. Ovid says that the Sirens had the feet and feathers of birds, but the faces of virgins; and he asks why these daughters of Achelous, as he calls them, had this hybrid form. Perhaps, he thinks, it was because they had been playing with Persephone when gloomy Dis carried her off, and they had begged the gods to grant them wings, that they might search for their lost playmate over seas as well as land. See Ov. Met. 5.552-562. In like manner Hyginus describes the Sirens as women above and fowls below, but he says that their wings and feathers were a punishment inflicted on them by Demeter for not rescuing Persephone from the clutches of Pluto. See Hyginus, Fab. 125, 141. Another story was that they were maidens whom Aphrodite turned into birds because they chose to remain unmarried. See Eustathius on Hom. Od. 12.47, p. 1709. It is said that they once vied with the Muses in singing, and that the Muses, being victorious, plucked off the Siren's feathers and made crowns out of them for themselves (Paus. 9.34.3). In ancient art, as in literature, the Sirens are commonly represented as women above and birds below. See Miss J. E. Harrison, Myths of the Odyssey (London, 1882), pp. 146ff. Homer says nothing as to the semi-bird shape of the Sirens, thus leaving us to infer that they were purely human.] Sailing by them, Ulysses wished to hear their song, so by Circe's advice he stopped the ears of his comrades with wax, and ordered that he should himself be bound to the mast. And being persuaded by the Sirens to linger, he begged to be released, but they bound him the more, and so he sailed past. Now it was predicted of the Sirens that they should themselves die when a ship should pass them; so die they did.^[This is not mentioned by Homer, but is affirmed by Hyginus, Fab. 125, 141). Others said that the Sirens cast themselves into the sea and were drowned from sheer vexation at the escape of Ulysses. See Scholiast on Hom. Od.xii.39; Eustathius on Hom. Od. 12.167, p. 1709; Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 712; compare Strab. 6.1.1.]

And after that he came to two ways. On the one side were the Wandering Rocks,^[As to Ulysses and the Wandering Rocks, see Hom. Od. 12.52-72; Hom. Od. 12.201-221. The poet mentions (Hom. Od. 12.70-72) the former passage of the Argo between the Wandering or Clashing Rocks, as to which see above Apollod. 1.9.22, with the note. It has been suggested that in the story of the Wandering Rocks we have a confused reminiscence of some sailor's story of floating icebergs. See Merry, on Homer, Od. xii.61.] and on the other side two huge cliffs, and in one of them was Scylla,^[As to the passage of Ulysses between Scylla and Charybdis, see Hom. Od. 12.73-126; Hom. Od. 12.222-259; Hyginus, Fab. 125, 199.] a daughter of Crataeis and Trienus or Phorcus,^[Homer mentions Crataeis as the mother of Scylla, but says nothing as to her father (Hom. Od. 12.124ff.). According to Stesichorus, the mother of Scylla was Lamia. See Scholiast on Hom. Od. 12.124; Eustathius on Hom. Od. xii.85, p. 1714. Apollonius Rhodius represents Scylla as a daughter of Phorcus by the night-wandering hag Hecate (Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.828ff.), and this parentage has the support of Acusilaus, except that he named her father Phorcys instead of Phorcus (Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon. iv.828; compare Eustathius on Hom. Od. xii.85, p. 1714). Hyginus calls her a daughter of Typhon and Echidna (Hyginus, Fab. 125, 151, and praefat. p. 31, ed. Bunte). A Scholiast on Plat. Rep. 9, 588c, who may have copied the present passage of Apollodorus, calls Scylla a daughter of Crataeis and Tyrrhenus or Phorcus, adding that she had the face and breasts of a woman, but from the flanks six heads of dogs and twelve feet. Some said that the father of Scylla was Triton (Eustathius on Hom. Od. xii.85, p. 1714); and perhaps the name Triton should be read instead of Trienus in the present passage of Apollodorus. See the Critical Note.] with the face and breast of a woman, but from the flanks she had six heads and twelve feet of dogs. And in the other cliff was Charybdis, who thrice a day drew up the water and spouted it again. By the advice of Circe he shunned the passage by the Wandering Rocks, and in sailing past the cliff of Scylla he stood fully armed on the poop. But Scylla appeared, snatched six of his comrades, and gobbled them up. And thence he came to Thrinacia, an island of the Sun, where kine were grazing, and being windbound, he tarried there.^[As to the adventures of Ulysses in Thrinacia, the island of the Sun, see Hom. Od. 12.127-141; Hom. Od. 12.260-402.] But when his comrades slaughtered some of the kine and banqueted on them, for lack of food, the Sun reported it to Zeus, and when Ulysses put out to sea, Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt.^[See Hom. Od. 12.403-425.] And when the ship broke up, Ulysses clung to the mast and drifted to Charybdis. And when Charybdis sucked down the mast, he clutched an overhanging wild fig-tree and waited, and when he saw the mast shot up again, he cast himself on it, and was carried across to the island of Ogygia.^[See Hom. Od. 12.426-450, compare Hom. Od. 5.128-135.]

There Calypso, daughter of Atlas, received him, and bedding with him bore a son Latinus. He stayed with her five years, and then made a raft and sailed away.^[As to the stay of Ulysses with Calypso in the island of Ogygia, and his departure in a boat of his own building, see Hom. Od. 5.13-281; Hom. Od. 7.243-266; Hyginus, Fab. 125. According to Hom. Od. 7.259, Ulysses stayed seven years with Calypso, not five years, as Apollodorus says. Hyginus limits the stay to one year. Homer does not mention that Calypso bore a son to Ulysses. In the Theogony of Hesiod (Hes. Th. 1111ff.) it is said that Circe (not Calypso), bore two sons, Agrius and Latinus, to Ulysses; the verses, however, are probably not by Hesiod but have been interpolated by a later poet of the Roman era in order to provide the Latins with a distinguished Greek ancestry. The verses are quoted by the Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon. iii.200. Compare Joannes Lydus, De mensibus i.13, p. 7, ed. Bekker. Eustathius says (Eustathius on Hom. Od. xvi.118, p. 1796) that, according to Hesiod, Ulysses had two sons, Agrius and Latinus, by Circe, and two sons, Nausithous and Nausinous, by Calypso.] But on the high sea the raft was broken in pieces by the wrath of Poseidon, and Ulysses was washed up naked on the shore of the Phaeacians.^[See Hom. Od. 5.282-493; Hyginus, Fab. 125.] Now Nausicaa, the daughter of king Alcinous, was washing the clothes, and when Ulysses implored her protection, she brought him to Alcinous, who entertained him, and after bestowing gifts on him sent him away with a convoy to his native land.^[See Hom. Od. 6; Hom. Od. 7; Hom. Od. 8; Hom. Od. 12.1-124; Hyginus, Fab. 125.] But Poseidon was wroth with the Phaeacians, and he turned the ship to stone and enveloped the city with a mountain.^[See Hom. Od. 12.125-187. "Poseidon does not propose to bury the city, but to shut it off from the use of its two harbours (cp. Hom. Od. 6.263) by some great mountain mass" (Merry on Hom. Od. 12.152).]

And on arriving in his native land Ulysses found his substance wasted; for, believing that he was dead, suitors were wooing Penelope.^[The number of the suitors, according to Homer, was one hundred and eight, namely, fifty-two from Dulichium, twenty-four from Same, twenty from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca. See Hom. Od. 16.245-253. Apollodorus gives the numbers from these islands as fifty-seven, twenty-three, forty-four, and twelve respectively, or a hundred and thirty-six in all. Homer does not give a regular list of the names, but mentions some of them incidentally.] From Dulichium came fifty-seven: Amphinomus, Thoas, Demoptolemus, Amphimachus, Euryalus, Paralus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Eurypylus, Pylaemenes, Acamas, Thersilochus, Hagius, Clymenus, Philodemus, Meneptolemus, Damastor, Bias, Telmius, Polyidus, Astylochus, Schedius, Antigonus, Marpsius, Iphidamas, Argius, Glaucus, Calydoneus, Echion, Lamas, Andraemon, Agerochus, Medon, Agrius, Promus, Ctesius, Acarnan, Cycnus, Pseras, Hellanicus, Periphron, Megasthenes, Thrasymedes, Ormenius, Diopithes, Mecisteus, Antimachus, Ptolemaeus, Lestorides, Nicomachus, Polypoetes, and Ceraus. And from Samethere came twenty—three:— Agelaus, Pisander, Elatus, Ctesippus, Hippodochus, Eurystratus, Archemolus, Ithacus, Pisenor, Hyperenor, Pheroetes, Antisthenes, Cerberus, Perimedes, Cynnus, Thriasus, Eteoneus, Clytius, Prothous, Lycaethus, Eumelus, Itanus, Lyammus. And from Zacynthos came forty—four: Eurylochus, Laomedes, Molebus, Phrenius, Indius, Minis, Liocritus, Pronomus, Nisas, Daemon, Archestratus, Hippomachus, Euryalus, Periallus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Polybus, Polydorus, Thadytius, Stratius, Phrenius, Indius, Daesenor, Laomedon, Laodicus, Halius, Magnes, Oloetrochus, Barthas, Theophron, Nissaeus, Alcarops, Periclymenus, Antenor, Pellas, Celtus, Periphus, Ormenus, Polybus and Andromedes. And from Ithaca itself the suitors were twelve, to wit:— Antinous, Pronous, Liodes, Eurynomus, Amphimachus, Amphialus, Promachus, Amphimedon, Aristratus, Helenus, Dulicheus, and Ctesippus.

These, journeying to the palace, consumed the herds of Ulysses at their feasts.^[As to the reckless waste of the suitors, see Hom. Od. 14.80-109.] And Penelope was compelled to promise that she would wed when the shroud of Laertes was finished, and she wove it for three years, weaving it by day and undoing it by night. In this way the suitors were deceived by Penelope, till she was detected.^[As to Penelope's web, see Hom. Od. 19.136-158; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] And Ulysses, being apprized of the state of things at home, came to his servant Eumaeus in the guise of a beggar,^[As to the meeting of Ulysses and Eumaeus, see Hom. Od. 14.1-492; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] and made himself known to Telemachus,^[As to the meeting and recognition of Ulysses and Telemachus, see Hom. Od. 16.1-234.] and arrived in the city. And Melanthius, the goatherd, a servant man, met them, and scorned them.^[See Hom. Od. 17.184-253.] On coming to the palace Ulysses begged food of the suitors,^[See Hom. Od. 17.360-457.] and finding a beggar called Irus he wrestled with him.^[See Hom. Od. 18.1-107; Hyginus, Fab. 126. In Homer it is in a boxing-match, not in a wrestling-bout, that Ulysses vanquishes the braggart beggar Irus. Hyginus, like Apollodorus, substitutes wrestling for boxing.] But he revealed himself to Eumaeus and Philoetius, and along with them and Telemachus he laid a plot for the suitors.^[See Hom. Od. 21.188-244.] Now Penelope delivered to the suitors the bow of Ulysses, which he had once received from Iphitus; and she said that she would marry him who bent the bow.^[See Hom. Od. 21.1-82; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] When none of them could bend it, Ulysses took it and shot down the suitors, with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.^[See Hom. Od. 21.140-434, Hom. Od. 22.1-389; Hyginus, Fab. 126.] He killed also Melanthius, and the handmaids that bedded with the suitors,^[See Hom. Od. 22.417-477.] and he made himself known to his wife and his father.^[See Hom. Od. 22.153-297; Hom. Od. 24.205-348.]

And after sacrificing to Hades, and Persephone, and Tiresias, he journeyed on foot through Epirus, and came to the Thesprotians, and having offered sacrifice according to the directions of the soothsayer Tiresias, he propitiated Poseidon.^[Tiresias had warned Ulysses that, after slaying the suitors, he must journey inland till he came to a country where men knew not the sea, and where a wayfarer would mistake for a winnowing-fan the oar which Ulysses was carrying on his shoulder. There Ulysses was to sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Poseidon, the god whom he had offended. See Hom. Od. 11.119-131. But the journey itself and the sacrifice are not recorded by Homer. In a little island off Cos a Greek skipper told Dr. W. H. D. Rouse a similar story about the journey inland of the prophet Elias. The prophet, according to this account, was a fisherman who, long buffeted by storms, conceived a horror of the sea, and, putting an oar on his shoulder, took to the hills and walked till he met a man who did not know what an oar was. There the prophet planted his oar in the ground, and there he resolved to abide. That is why all the prophet's chapels are on the tops of hills. This legend was published by Dr. Rouse in The Cambridge Review under the heading of "A Greek skipper." This and the remaining part of Apollodorus are probably drawn from the epic poem Telegony, a work by Eugammon of Cyrene, of which a short abstract by Proclus has been preserved. See Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta, ed. G. Kinkel, pp. 57ff. The author of the abstract informs us that after the death and burial of the suitors "Ulysses sacrificed to the nymphs and sailed to Elis to inspect the herds. And he was entertained by Polyxenus and received a present of a bowl. And after that followed the episodes of Trophonius, and Agamedes, and Augeas. Then he sailed home to Ithaca and offered the sacrifices prescribed by Tiresias. And after these things he went to the Thesprotians and married Callidice, queen of the Thesprotians. Then the Thesprotians made war on the Brygians, under the leadership of Ulysses. There Ares put Ulysses and his people to flight, and Athena engaged him in battle; but Apollo reconciled them. And after Callidice's death, Polypoetes, son of Ulysses, succeeded to the kingdom, and Ulysses himself went to Ithaca. Meanwhile Telegonus, sailing in search of his father, landed in Ithaca and ravaged the island; and marching out to repel him Ulysses was killed by his son in ignorance. Recognizing his error, Telegonus transported his father's body, and Telemachus, and Penelope to his mother, and she made them immortal. And Telegonus married Penelope, and Telemachus married Circe." The tradition, mentioned also by Hyginus, Fab. 127, that one son of Ulysses (Telegonus) married his father's widow (Penelope), and that another son (Telemachus) married his father's concubine (Circe), is very remarkable, and may possibly point to an old custom according to which a son inherited his father's wives and concubines, with the exception of his own mother. Compare Apollod. 2.7.7, with Frazer's note (vol. i. p. 269). Apollodorus mentions the marriage of Telegonus to Penelope (see below), but not the marriage of Telemachus to Circe.] But Callidice, who was then queen of the Thesprotians, urged him to stay and offered him the kingdom; and she had by him a son Polypoetes. And having married Callidice, he reigned over the Thesprotians, and defeated in battle the neighboring peoples who attacked him. But when Callidice died he handed over the kingdom to his son and repaired to Ithaca, and there he found Poliporthes, whom Penelope had borne to him.^[Compare Paus. 8.12.6, from whom we learn that the birth of this son Poliporthes or Ptoliporthes, as Pausanias calls him, was mentioned in the epic poem Thesprotis.] When Telegonus learned from Circe that he was a son of Ulysses, he sailed in search of him. And having come to the island of Ithaca, he drove away some of the cattle, and when Ulysses defended them, Telegonus wounded him with the spear he had in his hands, which was barbed with the spine of a sting-ray, and Ulysses died of the wound.^[Compare Oppian, Halieut. ii.497-500; Scholia Graeca in Homeri Odysseam, ed. G. Dindorf, vol. i. p. 6; Hom. Od. 11.134; Eustathius on Hom. Od. xi.133, p. 1676; Philostratus, Vit. Apollon. vi.32; Philostratus, Her. iii.42; Parthenius, Narrat. 3; Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 794; Scholiast on Aristoph. Plutus 303; Cicero, Tusc. Disp. ii.21.48ff.; Hor. Carm. 3.29.8; Hyginus, Fab. 127; Ovid, Ibis 567ff.; Dictys Cretensis vi.14ff.; Serv. Verg. A. 2.44. The fish (τρυγών), whose spine is said to have barbed the fatal spear, is the common stingray (Trygon pastinaca), as I learn from Professor D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, who informs me that the fish is abundant in the Mediterranean and not uncommon on our southern coasts. For ancient descriptions of the fish he refers me to Oppian, Halieut. ii.470ff. (the locus classicus); Ael., Nat. Anim. i.56; Nicander, Ther. 828ff. According to Aelian, the wound inflicted by the stingray is incurable. Hercules is said to have lost one of his fingers by the bite of a stingray (Ptolemy Hephaest., Nov. Hist. ii. in Westermann's Mythographi Graeci, p. 184). Classical scholars, following Liddell and Scott, sometimes erroneously identify the fish with the roach. The death of Ulysses through the wound of a stingray is foreshadowed in the prophecy of Tiresias that his death would come from the sea (Hom. Od. 11.134ff.). According to a Scholiast on Hom. (Scholia Graeca in Homeri Odysseam, ed. G. Dindorf, vol. i. p. 6), Hyginus, and Dictys Cretensis, Ulysses had been warned by an oracle or a dream to beware of his son, who would kill him; accordingly, fearing to be slain by Telemachus, he banished him to Cephallenia (Dictys Cretensis vi.14). But he forgot his son Telegonus, whom he had left behind with his mother Circe in her enchanted island. The death of Ulysses at the hands of his son Telegonus was the subject of a tragedy by Sophocles. See The Fragments of Sophocles, ed. A. C. Pearson, vol. ii. pp. 105ff.] But when Telegonus recognized him, he bitterly lamented, and conveyed the corpse and Penelope to Circe, and there he married Penelope. And Circe sent them both away to the Islands of the Blest.

But some say that Penelope was seduced by Antinous and sent away by Ulysses to her father Icarius, and that when she came to Mantinea in Arcadia she bore Pan to Hermes.^[A high mound of earth was shown as the grave of Penelope at Mantinea in Arcadia. According to the Mantinean story, Ulysses had found her unfaithful and banished her the house; so she went first to her native Sparta, and afterwards to Mantinea, where she died and was buried. See Paus. 8.12.5ff. The tradition that Penelope was the mother of Pan by Hermes (Mercury) is mentioned by Cicero, De natura deorum iii.22.56. According to Duris, the Samian, Penelope was the mother of Pan by all the suitors (Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron 772). The same story is mentioned also by Serv. Verg. A. 2.44, who says that Penelope was supposed to have given birth to Pan during her husband's absence, and that when Ulysses came home and found the monstrous infant in the house, he fled and set out afresh on his wanderings.] However others say that she met her end at the hands of Ulysses himself on account of Amphinomus,^[Amphinomus was one of the suitors of Penelope; his words pleased her more than those of the other suitors, because he had a good understanding. See Hom. Od. 16.394-398. He was afterwards killed by Telemachus (Hom. Od. 12. 89ff.). The suspicion that Penelope was unfaithful to her husband has no support in Homer.] for they allege that she was seduced by him. And there are some who say that Ulysses, being accused by the kinsfolk of the slain, submitted the case to the judgment of Neoptolemus, king of the islands off Epirus; that Neoptolemus, thinking to get possession of Cephallenia if once Ulysses were put out of the way, condemned him to exile;^[Compare Plut. Quaest. Graec. 14. According to Plutarch's account, the kinsmen of the slain suitors rose in revolt against Ulysses; but Neoptolemus, being invited by both parties to act as arbitrator, sentenced Ulysses to banishment for bloodshed, and condemned the friends and relatives of the suitors to pay an annual compensation to Ulysses for the damage they had done to his property. The sentence obliged Ulysses to withdraw not only from Ithaca, but also from Cephallenia and Zacynthus; and he retired to Italy. The compensation exacted from the heirs of the suitors was paid in kind, and consisted of barley groats, wine, honey, olive oil, and animal victims of mature age. This payment Ulysses ordered to be made to his son Telemachus.] and that Ulysses went to Aetolia, to Thoas, son of Andraemon, married the daughter of Thoas, and leaving a son Leontophonus, whom he had by her,^[These last recorded doings of Ulysses appear to be mentioned by no other ancient writer.] died in old age.[^e569cddbc8dc4b569101db545e229ec7]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Sabratha from Divus Vespasianus



Meanwhile, he married Flavia Domitilla, who had formerly been the mistress of Statilius Capella, a Roman knight of Sabrata in Africa, who [Domitilla] enjoyed Latin rights; and was soon after declared fully and freely a citizen of Rome, on a trial before the court of Recovery, brought by her father Flavius Liberalis, a native of Ferentum, but no more than secretary to a quaestor. By her he had the following children: Titus, Domitia nd Domitilla. He outlived his wife and daughter, and lost them both before he became emperor. After the death of his wife he renewed his union^["Revocavit in contubernium." From the difference of our habits, there is no word in the English language which exactly conveys the meaning of contubernium; a word which, in a military sense, the Romans applied to the intimate fellowship between comrades in war who messed together, and lived in close fellowship in the same tent. Thence they transferred it to a union with one woman who was in a higher position than a concubine, but, for some reason, could not acquire the legal rights of a wife, as in the case of slaves of either sex. A man of rank, also, could not marry a slave or a freedwoman, however much he might be attached to her.] with his former concubine, Caenis, the freedwoman of Antonia, and also her amanuensis, and treated her, even after he was emperor, almost as if she had been his lawful wife.^[Nearly the same phrases. are applied by Suetonius to Drusilla, see CALIGULA, c. xxiv., and to Marcella, the concubine of Commodus, by Herodian, 1. xvi. 9 , where he says that she had all the honours of an empress, except that the incense was not offered to her. These connections resembled the left-hand marriages of the German princes.][^30f0a4162fd4430dad05e03fb65e3fc3]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Oea from Historiae



But when the agitation of the people, the execution of the centurion, and other news, true or false, exaggerated as usual by report, came to the ears of Festus, he sent some cavalry to put Piso to death. They rode over at full speed, and broke into the dwelling of the proconsul in the dim light of early dawn, with their swords drawn in their hands. Many of them were unacquainted with the person of Piso, for the legate had selected some Moorish and Carthaginian auxiliaries to perpetrate the deed. Near the proconsul's chamber they chanced to meet a slave, and asked him who he was, and where Piso was to be found? The slave with a noble untruth replied, "I am he," and was immediately cut down. Soon after Piso was killed, for there was on the spot one who recognized him, Bæbius Massa, one of the procurators of Africa, a name even then fatal to the good, and destined often to reappear among the causes of the sufferings which he had ere long to endure. From Adrumetum, where he had stayed to watch the result, Festus went to the legion, and gave orders that Cetronius Pisanus, prefect of the camp, should be put in irons. He did this out of private pique, but he called the man an accomplice of Piso. Some few centurions and soldiers he punished, others he rewarded, neither the one nor the other deservedly, but he wished men to believe that he had extinguished a war. He then put an end to a quarrel between the Œenses and the Leptitani, which, originating in robberies of corn and cattle by two rustic populations, had grown from this insignificant beginning till it was carried on in pitched battles. The people of Œea, who were inferior in numbers, had summoned to their aid the Garamantes, a wild race incessantly occupied in robbing their neighbours. This had brought the Leptitani to extremities; their territories had been ravaged far and wide, and they were trembling within their walls, when the Garamantes were put to flight by the arrival of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry, and the whole of the booty was recaptured, with the exception of some which the plunderers, in their wanderings through inaccessible hamlets, had sold to more distant tribes.[^0516cd2ae8cd458badd83d8f1c4cee91]

### A story by Flavius Josephus about Cyrene from Life of Josephus



But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea, and conjectured that the lands which I had in Judea would bring me no profit, because a garrison to guard the country was afterward to pitch there, he gave me another country in the plain. And when he was going away to Rome, he made choice of me to sail along with him, and paid me great respect: and when we were come to Rome, I had great care taken of me by Vespasian; for he gave me an apartment in his own house, which he lived in before he came to the empire. He also honored me with the privilege of a Roman citizen, and gave me an annual pension; and continued to respect me to the end of his life, without any abatement of his kindness to me; which very thing made me envied, and brought me into danger; for a certain Jew, whose name was Jonathan, who had raised a tumult in Cyrene, and had persuaded two thousand men of that country to join with him, was the occasion of their ruin. But when he was bound by the governor of that country, and sent to the emperor, he told him that I had sent him both weapons and money. However, he could not conceal his being a liar from Vespasian, who condemned him to die; according to which sentence he was put to death. Nay, after that, when those that envied my good fortune did frequently bring accusations against me, by God's providence I escaped them all. I also received from Vespasian no small quantity of land, as a free gift, in Judea; about which time I divorced my wife also, as not pleased with her behavior, though not till she had been the mother of three children, two of whom are dead, and one whom I named Hyrcanus, is alive. After this I married a wife who had lived at Crete, but a Jewess by birth: a woman she was of eminent parents, and such as were the most illustrious in all the country, and whose character was beyond that of most other women, as her future life did demonstrate. By her I had two sons; the elder's name was Justus, and the next Simonides, who was also named Agrippa. And these were the circumstances of my domestic affairs. However, the kindness of the emperor to me continued still the same; for when Vespasian was dead, Titus, who succeeded him in the government, kept up the same respect for me which I had from his father; and when I had frequent accusations laid against me, he would not believe them. And Domitian, who succeeded, still augmented his respects to me; for he punished those Jews that were my accusers, and gave command that a servant of mine, who was a eunuch, and my accuser, should be punished. He also made that country I had in Judea tax free, which is a mark of the greatest honor to him who hath it; nay, Domitia, the wife of Caesar, continued to do me kindnesses. And this is the account of the actions of my whole life; and let others judge of my character by them as they please. But to thee, O Epaphroditus,^[Of this Epaphroditus, see the note on the Preface to the Antiquities.] thou most excellent of men! do I dedicate all this treatise of our Antiquities; and so, for the present, I here conclude the whole.[^9961200f42484f8ebf9335ec40395171]

### A story by Flavius Josephus about Ptolemais from Life of Josephus



Now king Agrippa sent an army to make themselves masters of the citadel of Gamala, and over it Equieulus Modius; but the forces that were sent were not allow to encompass the citadel quite round, but lay before it in the open places, and besieged it. But when Ebutius the decurion, who was intrusted with the government of the great plain, heard that I was at Simonias, a village situated in the confines of Galilee, and was distant from him sixty furlongs, he took a hundred horsemen that were with him by night, and a certain number of footmen, about two hundred, and brought the inhabitants of the city Gibea along with him as auxiliaries, and marched in the night, and came to the village where I abode. Upon this I pitched my camp over against him, which had a great number of forces in it: but Ebutius tried to draw us down into the plain, as greatly depending upon his horsemen; but we would not come down; for when I was satisfied of the advantage that his horse would have if we came down into the plain, while we were all footmen, I resolved to join battle with the enemy where I was. Now Ebutius and his party made a courageous opposition for some time; but when he saw that his horse were useless to him in that place, he retired back to the city Gibea, having lost three of his men in the fight. So I followed him directy with two thousand armed men; and when I was at the city Besara, that lay in the confines of Ptolemais, but twenty furlongs from Gibea, where Ebutius abode, I placed my armed men on the outside of the village, and gave orders that they should guard the passes with great care, that the enemy might not disturb us until we should have carried off the corn, a great quantity of which lay there: it belonged to Bernice the queen, and had been gathered together out of the neighboring villages into Besara; so I loaded my camels and asses, a great number of which I had brought along with me, and sent the corn into Galilee. When I had done this, I offered Ebutius battle; but when he would not accept of the offer, for he was terrified at our readiness and courage, I altered my route, and marched towards Neopolitanus, because I had heard that the country about Tiberias was laid waste by him. This Neopolitanus was captain of a troop of horse, and had the custody of Scythopolis intrusted to his care by the enemy; and when I had hindered him from doing any further mischief to Tiberias, I set myself to make provision for the affairs of Galilee.[^696ee6b52d6348c1b2a366c5f76a37de]

### A story by Pindar about Cyrene from Pythian



Today you must stand beside a man dear to me,  
by the king of horsefamed Cyrene,  
and joining with Archesilaus in his victory revels,  
Muse, swell the breeze of songs  
owed to Leto's Twins and to Pytho,  
where once the priestess sitting in honor  
beside the golden eagles of Zeus,  
Apollo now in his land, proclaimed  
by oracle that Battos would be founder  
of fruitbearing Libya,  
so that he'd finally leave the holy  
island and plant  
a city of fine chariots  
on a chalky breast of earth,  
and redeem in the seventeenth generation  
the word of Medea  
which at Thera once Aeëtes' fierce daughter  
breathed from immortal lips,  
the Colchean queen.  
Thus she spoke to the demigods  
who sailed with spearman Jason:  
"Hear me, you sons  
of bold-hearted men and gods:  
I say that from this wave-beaten land  
the daughter of Epaphus will one day  
be planted with the root of other cities,  
cities renowned among men,  
amid the foundations of Zeus Ammon.  
"And, changing short-finned dolphins  
for swift horses,  
they shall ply reins rather than oars  
and drive chariots with stormfoot teams.  
That Omen shall make Thera  
metropolis of mighty cities, the Omen  
which once amid the stream from lake Triton,  
Euphemus, descending the prow,  
received from a god in human form  
who offered him  
a guest-gift of earth  
—for him father Zeus, son of Kronos,  
rang out a peal of auspicious thunder—:  
"at the time he met us hoisting against ship  
the bronze-fluked anchor,  
swift Argo's bridle;  
for twelve days before we'd been carrying  
the seagoing timber from Ocean  
over desolate stretches of land,  
having drawn her up at my advice.  
Then in that instant all alone  
the god approached us,  
assuming the glad countenance  
of a solicitous man;  
and he began with friendly words,  
those the charitable host first uses  
to offer newly-arrived strangers a meal.  
But the plea of our sweet homecoming  
checked us staying. He said he was  
Eurypylus, son of the immortal  
Holder and Shaker of earth;  
he knew our haste; swiftly  
scooping up a handful of soil  
with his right hand, he sought to give us  
a chance gift of hospitality;  
nor did he refuse it, the hero, but leapt to shore  
and, pressing hand with hand,  
accepted the divine clod.  
But I hear it was washed  
overboard one evening  
to wander seaward with the salt  
waves, following the sinuous waters  
of the deep. Often indeed I urged  
the attendants, who ease our labor,  
to guard it; but they forgot,  
and now the imperishable seed  
of spacious Libya  
is shed on this island before its time.  
For had he cast the seed down at home  
by Hade's earthfast mouth,  
after returning to sacred Tanaeus, Euphemus,  
horse-ruling Poseidon's lordly son,  
whom Europa, daughter of Tityos,  
once bore by the banks of Cephesus,  
his blood in the fourth generation after him  
would have seized that vast continent  
together with the Danaans;  
for then will they depart from great Sparta,  
from the gulf of Argos and from Mycenae.  
Now, however, in the beds of alien women  
he shall discover a chosen race  
who, by favor of the gods,  
will come to this island  
and beget a man to be  
lord over plains  
cloaked in cloudshadow;  
and one day Apollo, in his gold-filled house,  
will admonish him by oracle,  
when at length he enters the Pythian shrine,  
to lead a host of men in ships  
to the rich precinct of Zeus Ammon by the Nile."  
So spoke the ranks of Media's speech,  
and they crouched stockstill, in silence,  
the godlike heroes  
listening to her shrewd counsel.  
O fortunate son of Polymnestus,  
you it was whom, as this speech foretold,  
the oracle of the Delphic Bee  
exalted with her spontaneous shout,  
she who thrice crying "Hail"  
revealed you the predestined  
king of Cyrene,  
when you were asking what release might come  
from the gods for a stammering voice.  
After long time, even now, as at the peak  
of crimson-flowered spring,  
eighth in line from these children blossoms  
Archesilaus: to whom Apollo and Pytho  
granted glory in the chariot race  
from the hands of the Amphictyons.  
I shall offer to the Muses  
him and the golden fleece of the ram:  
for when the Minyans sailed after it,  
heaven-sent honors  
were planted for them.  
What then was the beginning of their voyage,  
what danger shackled them with strong spikes of adamant?  
It was destined that Pelias die  
by the hands of Aeolus' noble sons  
or by their relentless designs.  
And a prophecy came to him  
chilling his crafty heart,  
spoken beside the navel-stone  
in the middle of treeteeming mother earth:  
to mount close guard all round  
against the man with one sandal  
when he descends from mountain lairs  
into the clear-seen land  
of famous Iolkos,  
whether stranger or citizen. And so in time  
he came, a man with two spears, stupendous;  
a double garment covered him,  
the Magnesians' native dress  
closely fitting his marvelous limbs,  
and round about it a leopard skin  
kept off the shivering rain;  
the lustrous locks of his hair  
had not been cut and lost,  
but cascaded down his entire back.  
Swiftly he went straight on,  
trying the mettle of his unshaken will,  
and in the middle of the square  
stood among the thronging crowd.  
No one knew him; but awestruck  
as they were, someone spoke thus:  
"Surely this isn't Apollo,  
nor is it bronze-charioted Ares,  
lord of Aphrodite; and they say  
that on gleaming Naxos died  
Iphimedeia's sons,  
Otos and you, daring lord Ephialtes.  
Then too Tityus fell  
hunted down by Artemis' swift arrow  
springing from her invincible quiver,  
so that a man might crave  
to caress possible loves."  
Such things they spoke in turn  
to one another; and on his polished  
mule-cart came Pelias rushing in  
pell-mell: he was at once astonished  
as he glanced uneasily at the single sandal  
conspicuous on its right foot.  
But hiding the fear in his heart  
he accosted him:  
"What country, stranger,  
do you declare your fatherland?  
And who among earth-born men  
sent you forth from her venerable womb?  
Without defiling it through hateful lies,  
tell me your race."  
With gentle words, all unperturbed,  
he answered him thus: "I say  
that I am he who bears the teaching of Chiron.  
For I come from his cave, from Chariclo and Philyra,  
where the Centaur's spotless daughters  
raised me. After completing 20 years  
without a single crooked act  
or uttering one such word to them,  
I have returned home to reclaim  
my father's ancient right of rule  
—now exercised improperly—  
which Zeus once granted  
to Aeolus, leader of the people,  
and to his sons.  
For I hear that lawless Pelias,  
following his cold, manipulative wits,  
stripped it by force from my parents,  
the legitimate sovereigns;  
when first I saw the light,  
they, fearing the violence  
of that insolent leader, darkened the house  
in mourning mixed with women's wailing,  
as if I'd died, and then secretly  
sent me away in purple swaddling-clothes,  
entrusting night with my journey,  
and gave me to Chiron,  
Cronos' son, to raise.  
Now you know the highlights of my story;  
point out plainly, my fellow citizens, the house  
of my parents, masters of white horses;  
for I am one of you, the son of Aeson,  
and come no stranger to an alien land.  
The godlike beast, whenever he addressed me,  
called me Jason."  
Thus he spoke, and as he entered  
his father's eyes recognized him;  
and from his aged eyelids  
burst the welling tears,  
for he rejoiced in his soul  
when he saw his child, the matchless,  
the fairest of men.  
And both his brothers came to them  
at news of his arrival:  
from nearby Pheres, who left the fountain Hypereia,  
and from Messene Amythaon;  
and quickly came Admetus and Melampus,  
well-wishers, to their cousin.  
Amid the feasting  
Jason welcomed them  
with honey-sweet words,  
providing them fit hospitality,  
and stretched their reveling out to plenty,  
as he reaped through five full nights  
and five days  
the holy flower of intense life.  
But, on the sixth day, telling the whole  
story soberly from the start,  
he confided it to his kinsmen,  
and they assented. Instantly he leaped  
from the couches along with them;  
and then they went to the hall of Pelias;  
bursting inside they took their stand;  
when the king heard them, he himself,  
the son of fair-haired Tyro, came to greet them;  
and Jason, distilling  
gentle discourse with a genial voice,  
laid the basis of wise words:  
"Son of Poseidon of the Rock,  
the minds of men are all too quick to praise  
deceitful gain above the right,  
though they are moving to a bitter morning after;  
but you and I ought rule  
our passions with justice  
and weave the web of future wealth.  
I speak to one who knows.  
One dam was mother to Cretheus  
and to daring-minded Salmoneus;  
and we, sprung in the third generation from them,  
look on the golden strength of the sun.  
The Fates withdraw  
if any malice comes on kinsmen  
to shroud their shame.  
It is unfitting for us two to sever  
with bronze-biting swords or spears  
the great birthright of our forefathers.  
For I give to you the flocks and tawny herds  
of cattle and all the fields,  
which you extorted from my parents  
and manage now to fatten up your wealth;  
it does not trouble me that these  
glut your house;  
but that monarchial scepter and throne  
on which, presiding once, the son of Creutheus  
guided his judgments straight  
to a race of horsemen;  
all these without our mutual strife  
surrender to me, lest from them arise  
some newer evil."  
So he spoke, and Pelias too  
responded softly: "I shall be such as you wish,  
but already the sere span of life envelops me,  
whereas your flower of youth  
is just now swelling to its crest:  
you can appease the wrath of the dead.  
For Phrixus orders us,  
proceeding to Aeëtes' palace halls,  
to bring his soul back home  
and carry off the deep-fleeced hide of the ram,  
on which he once escaped from the sea  
and from the godless weapons of his stepmother.  
A wondrous dream came speaking this to me.  
I've asked the oracle at Castalia  
if such a quest should be pursued: and it urges me  
to instantly dispatch an expedition by ship.  
Accomplish, voluntarily, this task  
and I swear that I will yield you back  
to wield sole power and to rule.  
And as a mighty pledge,  
let Zeus be witness,  
the father of both our families."  
Approving this arrangement,  
they parted company. But Jason was already  
in hot haste inciting the heralds  
to announce everywhere  
that a voyage was under way.  
Quickly came the three sons, indomitable in war,  
of Cronian Zeus  
born to round-eyed Alcmene and Leda,  
and from Pylos and Taenarus' promontory  
the two top-knotted warriors  
sprung from the Earthshaker,  
respecting their own might with awe;  
whose noble glory found fulfillment,  
that of Euphemus and yours, mighty Periclymenus.  
And from Apollo came  
the master lyrist, father of songs,  
renowned Orpheus.  
Hermes goldenwand  
sent his twin sons  
to unceasing labor on the quest,  
Echion and Erytus, flushed with youth.  
And quickly came those  
who dwelt at the base of Mount Pangaeus:  
for willingly with joyful heart  
the King of Winds, their father Boreas,  
more swiftly urged on Zetes and Cala=EFs,  
mortal men whose backs were beating  
with purple wings.  
Hera kindled in these demigods  
allsuasive sweet desire  
for the ship Argo, that none be left behind  
lingering by his mother's side  
to coddle long a life devoid of danger,  
but to discover with his agemates,  
even at the price of death,  
the fairest way to win his own exploits.  
And when the flower of sailors  
came down to Iolkos, Jason  
counted and praised d them all.  
And then the prophet Mopsus,  
divining by birds and sacred sortilege,  
embarked the army readily.  
When they had slung  
the anchors high above the beak,  
taking a golden bowl in his hands  
the captain, from the stern, called on  
the father of the Uranidae, Zeus the lightning-speared,  
for the wavesurge and the winds  
to be swift running, for the nights and sea  
paths and days to be serene,  
and for their homecoming to be fortunate;  
and from the clouds Zeus answered him  
with an auspicious clap of thunder;  
and bright bolts of lighting  
broke from the sky.  
The heroes caught their breath  
trusting the signs of the god;  
the portent-seer summoned them  
to fall to oars, announcing  
his sweet hopes;  
and the rowing ran out  
from under their swift hands insatiably.  
Conducted by the breezes of the South Wind  
they came to the mouth  
of the Inhospitable Sea,  
where they established a sacred precinct  
for Poseidon of the sea:  
there was at hand a ruddy herd of Thracian cattle  
and, newly built of stones, a hollow altar.  
Rushing now into deep danger  
they implored the Lord of Ships  
to escape the irresistible movement  
of the Clashing Rocks. For both were alive,  
and rolled more rapidly  
than battle ranks of deep-roaring winds;  
but that voyage of demigods  
finally brought their end.  
To Phasis then they came,  
where they set their might  
against the crushing Chochians  
in presence of Aeëtes himself.  
But the sovereign of swiftest darts,  
Cyprogeneia, binding  
the dappled wryneck  
four-spoked upon an indissoluble wheel  
first brought the maddening bird  
to human kind and thus taught Aeson's son  
skill in invocations and incantations,  
that he might strip Medea of all reverence  
for her parents and that Hellas, fiercely desired,  
might set her whirling, as she blazed in spirit,  
with the scourge of Persuasion.  
And she at once revealed  
the outcome of her father's trials:  
preparing then the sap of roots with oil  
for remedy against remorseless pain,  
she gave it him to anoint his limbs.  
They thus agreed by mutual consent  
to join with one another in sweet union.  
But when Aeëtes had planted in their midst  
the adamantine plow and the oxen,  
who were panting from tawny jaws  
a flame of searing fire  
and with their brazen hooves  
kept gouging up the earth in turn,  
alone he led and brought them to the yoke.  
Straight were the furrows he traced  
as he drove them up and down the ploughland,  
and cut the span of earth a fathom deep.  
Then spoke thus: "Let the king, whoever rules the ship,  
complete this task for me  
and carry off the imperishable bedding,  
the fleece gleaming with golden fringe."  
At these words, Jason threw off his saffron robe,  
and trusting to god, he set to work:  
the fire never daunted him, thanks to the orders  
of the gracious woman, all-powerful in remedies,  
but drawing out the plough,  
he bound the necks of the oxen  
in a harness of necessity,  
and thrusting into their sturdy sides  
an unwearied goad,  
the burly man completed  
his allotted span of labor. Aeëtes  
howled with inarticulate anguish  
marveling at his strength.  
Toward the mighty man his comrades  
were stretching out their hands and showering  
crowns of leaves over him  
as they greeted him with kindly words.  
And straight away the wondrous son of Helios  
told them where Phrixos' sacrificial knife  
had spread the resplendent pelt,  
but hoped that he would fail at least  
to do that task. For it lay  
within a thicket near  
the ravenous jaws of a dragon  
which, in length and breadth, exceeded  
a fifty-oared ship  
wrought by iron-nailing blows.  
Returning home by highway is too long;  
for time is pressing me  
and I know a short path:  
for many others I lead the way in skill.  
The glaring-eyed snake with speckled back,  
O Archesilaus, he slew by cunning,  
and stole with her own help Medea,  
the Peliasassassin.  
They came amid the immensity of Ocean,  
and the Red Sea,  
and the race of manslaughtering Lemnian women:  
there also in contests of their limbs  
they showed their strength for a prize cloak,  
and slept with them. In foreign  
furrows then the destined days or nights  
prosperously received the seed  
of your family's splendor:  
for there Euphemus' race was planted  
to tower up forever;  
and after sharing Spartan homes and ways  
they settled in time on the island  
once called "Fairest;"  
from there the son of Leto granted  
you the plain of Libya to enrich  
by favor of the gods  
and the holy city of golden-throned  
Cyrene to govern,  
you who contrived a craft of right counsel.  
Know now the wisdom of Oedipus:  
if someone with a sharp-bladed axe  
lopped off the branches of a mighty oak  
and marred its marvelous form,  
though desolate of fruit,  
it still gives testimony of itself,  
if ever it comes at last  
to feed the winter fire,  
or if, laid as lintel  
for a master's upright columns,  
it carries on despairing toil  
within an alien city wall,  
having left its own place empty.  
But you're the most appropriate physician  
and Paean honors you with healing light.  
One must apply a soothing hand  
to tend an ulcerous wound.  
It's easy for the almost impotent  
to shake a city;  
to set it back in place again  
is grinding conflict,  
unless a god will suddenly  
become a steersman for its leaders.  
For you is woven out this web of favors.  
Take heart to lavish full devotion  
on divinely blessed Cyrene.  
Among the sayings of Homer this one  
lay to mind and heed:  
a noble messenger, he said,  
bestows the greatest honor to each office;  
even the Muse grows strong by true report.  
Cyrene and the most illustrious house of Battus  
have come to know the upright mind  
of Damophilus. For that man—  
a youth among boys,  
but in counsels an elder  
who's gained a hundred years of life—  
bereaves an evil tongue  
of lucid voice,  
but has learned to hate the violent,  
not clashing with the noble  
or drawing out the end of any action.  
Brief is the span, for men,  
of opportunity. He knows it well;  
like an attendant, not a drudge, he follows it.  
They say this is the sharpest pain:  
to recognize the good  
but stand outside it by compulsion.  
Truly, that man is even now,  
like Atlas, wresting with the sky  
apart from fatherland apart from property.  
But Zeus eternal freed the Titans;  
in passing time,  
as winds subside, comes change  
of sails. But he prays,  
when he's exhausted this accursed affliction,  
to see his home one day,  
and by the fountain of Apollo,  
joining the symposia,  
to throw his heart into the joys of youth,  
and clasping the richly ornate lyre  
among his songwise citizens, to grasp peace,  
working harm to none nor suffering it  
from his countrymen;  
and he could tell, Archesilaus,  
what fountain of ambrosial verse he found  
when recently a guest at Thebes.

### A story by Flavius Josephus about Cyrene from Life of Josephus



But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea, and conjectured that the lands which I had in Judea would bring me no profit, because a garrison to guard the country was afterward to pitch there, he gave me another country in the plain. And when he was going away to Rome, he made choice of me to sail along with him, and paid me great respect: and when we were come to Rome, I had great care taken of me by Vespasian; for he gave me an apartment in his own house, which he lived in before he came to the empire. He also honored me with the privilege of a Roman citizen, and gave me an annual pension; and continued to respect me to the end of his life, without any abatement of his kindness to me; which very thing made me envied, and brought me into danger; for a certain Jew, whose name was Jonathan, who had raised a tumult in Cyrene, and had persuaded two thousand men of that country to join with him, was the occasion of their ruin. But when he was bound by the governor of that country, and sent to the emperor, he told him that I had sent him both weapons and money. However, he could not conceal his being a liar from Vespasian, who condemned him to die; according to which sentence he was put to death. Nay, after that, when those that envied my good fortune did frequently bring accusations against me, by God's providence I escaped them all. I also received from Vespasian no small quantity of land, as a free gift, in Judea; about which time I divorced my wife also, as not pleased with her behavior, though not till she had been the mother of three children, two of whom are dead, and one whom I named Hyrcanus, is alive. After this I married a wife who had lived at Crete, but a Jewess by birth: a woman she was of eminent parents, and such as were the most illustrious in all the country, and whose character was beyond that of most other women, as her future life did demonstrate. By her I had two sons; the elder's name was Justus, and the next Simonides, who was also named Agrippa. And these were the circumstances of my domestic affairs. However, the kindness of the emperor to me continued still the same; for when Vespasian was dead, Titus, who succeeded him in the government, kept up the same respect for me which I had from his father; and when I had frequent accusations laid against me, he would not believe them. And Domitian, who succeeded, still augmented his respects to me; for he punished those Jews that were my accusers, and gave command that a servant of mine, who was a eunuch, and my accuser, should be punished. He also made that country I had in Judea tax free, which is a mark of the greatest honor to him who hath it; nay, Domitia, the wife of Caesar, continued to do me kindnesses. And this is the account of the actions of my whole life; and let others judge of my character by them as they please. But to thee, O Epaphroditus,^[Of this Epaphroditus, see the note on the Preface to the Antiquities.] thou most excellent of men! do I dedicate all this treatise of our Antiquities; and so, for the present, I here conclude the whole.[^9bdfeea3b44f4cd5b688ee9157335772]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Ferentinum from Historiae



Thus Otho ended his life in the 37th year of his age. He came from the municipal town of Ferentinum. His father was of consular, his grandfather of prætorian rank. His family on the mother's side was of less distinction, but yet respectable. What his boyhood and his youth had been, we have already shewn. By two daring acts, one most atrocious, the other singularly noble, he earned in the eyes of posterity about an equal share of infamy and of glory. I should think it unbecoming the dignity of the task which I^[EMBARRASSMENT OF SENATE] have undertaken, to collect fabulous marvels, and to amuse with fiction the tastes of my readers; at the same time I would not venture to impugn the credit of common report and tradition. The natives of these parts relate that on the day when the battle was being fought at Bedriacum, a bird of unfamiliar appearance settled in a much frequented grove near Regium Lepidum, and was not frightened or driven away by the concourse of people, or by the multitude of birds that flocked round it, until Otho killed himself; then it vanished. When they came to compute the time, it was found that the commencement and the end of this strange occurrence tallied with the last scenes of Otho's life.[^fb9932022c67478b8ff86ff38f2291c6]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Casinum from Philippics



But the fact that the same man finds fault with my melancholy, and also with my jokes, is a great proof that I was very moderate in each particular.

You have said that no inheritances come to me. Would that this accusation of yours were a true one; I should have more of my friends and connections alive. But how could such a charge ever come into your head? For I have received more than twenty millions of sesterces in inheritances. Although in this particular I admit that you have been more fortunate than I. No one has ever made me his heir except he was a friend of mine, in order that my grief of mind for his loss might be accompanied also with some gain, if it was to be considered as such.

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Minturnae from For Plancius



Allow that you were more worthy than Plancius (though that point I will contest with you presently, though without at all disparaging your pretensions or character,) still allow that you were more worthy, yet it is not your competitor by whom you have been defeated, but the people by whom you have been passed over, that is in fault.

And in this affair you ought to recollect that at all comitia, and especially at those held for the election of aediles, it is the party spirit of the people, and not their deliberate judgment which bears sway, that their votes are coaxed out of them not extorted by merit, that the voters are more apt to consider what obligations they themselves are under to each individual, than what benefits the republic has received at his hands. But if you insist on it that it is their deliberate judgment, then you must not annul it but bear it.[^c2a45bd288b14f0fb69ec4a8e0e49a20]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Casinum from On the Agrarian Law



The fortieth clause of the law is one, O Romans, the mention of which I have hitherto purposely avoided, lest I should seem to be reopening a wound of the republic which was now scarred over, or to be renewing, at a most unseasonable time, some of our old dissensions. And now too I will argue that point, not because I do not think that this present condition of the republic deserving of being most zealously maintained, especially after I have professed myself to be for this year at least the patron of all tranquillity and unanimity in the republic; but in order to teach Rullus for the future to be silent at least in those matters with respect to which he wishes silence to be observed as to himself and his actions.[^28dc807591214c40a8501ad1b0efbea0]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Minturnae from Against Piso



Was I, forsooth, anxious to lean on the counsel or protection of that piece of senseless cattle, of that bit of rotten flesh? was I likely to seek for any support or ornament for myself from that contemptible carcass? I suppose I was looking for a consul, I say, but one (that I was not likely to find in that hog) who might uphold the cause of the republic with his dignity and wisdom, not one who like a stock or like a trunk of a tree, if he only stood upright, might maintain the title of consul. For as the whole of my cause was the cause of a consul and of the senate, I had need of the assistance of the consul and senate; one of which sources of aid was even turned by you when you were consuls to my injury; the other was entirely suspended, if not abolished in the republic.

But if you ask what were my intentions; I would not have yielded, and the republic should still have retained me in its embrace, if I had only had to contend with contemptible gladiators,^[The Latin is bustuarius; literally, one who fights at the funeral pile in honour of the dead.] and with you, and with your colleague. For the cause of that most admirable man Quintus Metellus was a wholly different one; a citizen whom, in my opinion, I consider equal in glory to the immortal gods;[^51b18cbcf24b4ee280349312324f109a]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Minturnae from Historiae



The fleet at Misenum, so much can be done in times of civil discord by the daring of even a single man, was drawn into revolt by Claudius Faventinus, a centurion cashiered by Galba, who forged letters in the name of Vespasian offering a reward for treachery. The fleet was under the command of Claudius Apollinaris, a man neither firm in his loyalty, nor energetic in his treason. Apinius Tiro, who had filled the office of prætor, and who then happened to be at Minturnæ, offered to head the revolt. By these men the colonies and municipal towns were drawn into the movement, and as Puteoli was particularly zealous for Vespasian, while Capua on the other hand remained loyal to Vitellius, they introduced their municipal jealousy into the civil war. Claudius Julianus, who had lately exercised an indulgent rule over the fleet at Misenum, was selected by Vitellius to soothe the irritation of the soldiery. He was supported by a city cohort and a troop of gladiators whose chief officer he was. As soon as the two camps were pitched, Julianus, without much hesitation, went over to the side of Vespasian, and they then occupied Tarracina, which was protected by its fortifications and position rather than by any ability of theirs.[^b037eef1068f48e3ae2e481434e697fe]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Casinum from Philippics



But you have dared besides (what is there which you would not dare?) to say that the Capito line Hill, when I was consul was full of aimed slaves. I was offering violence to the senate, I suppose, in order to compel the adoption of those infamous decrees of the senate. O wretched man, whether those things are not known to you (for you know nothing that is good), or whether they are, when you dare to speak so shamelessly before such men! For what Roman knight was there, what youth of noble birth except you, what man of any rank or class who recollected that he was a citizen, who was not on the Capitoline Hill while the senate was assembled in this temple? who was there, who did not give in his name? Although there could not be provided checks enough, nor were the books able to contain their names.[^d0e9230bb50c43d29c974836537164e0]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Casinum from Philippics



But the fact that the same man finds fault with my melancholy, and also with my jokes, is a great proof that I was very moderate in each particular.

You have said that no inheritances come to me. Would that this accusation of yours were a true one; I should have more of my friends and connections alive. But how could such a charge ever come into your head? For I have received more than twenty millions of sesterces in inheritances. Although in this particular I admit that you have been more fortunate than I. No one has ever made me his heir except he was a friend of mine, in order that my grief of mind for his loss might be accompanied also with some gain, if it was to be considered as such.

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Minturnae from For Plancius



Allow that you were more worthy than Plancius (though that point I will contest with you presently, though without at all disparaging your pretensions or character,) still allow that you were more worthy, yet it is not your competitor by whom you have been defeated, but the people by whom you have been passed over, that is in fault.

And in this affair you ought to recollect that at all comitia, and especially at those held for the election of aediles, it is the party spirit of the people, and not their deliberate judgment which bears sway, that their votes are coaxed out of them not extorted by merit, that the voters are more apt to consider what obligations they themselves are under to each individual, than what benefits the republic has received at his hands. But if you insist on it that it is their deliberate judgment, then you must not annul it but bear it.[^c217f8b83a7e468aa2954306ffcc94e3]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Formiae from Vitellius



He was sent by Galba into Lower Germany,^[A.U.C. 821] contrary to his expectation. It is supposed that he was assisted in procuring this appointment by the interest of Titus Junius, a man of great influence at that time; whose friendship he had long before gained by favouring the same set of charioteers with him in the Circensian games. But Galba openly declared that none were less to be feared than those who only cared for their bellies, and that even his enormous appetite must be satisfied with the plenty of that province; so that it is evident he was selected for that government more out of contempt than kindness. It is certain, that when he was to set out, he had not money for the expenses of his journey; he being at that time so much straitened in his circumstances, that he was obliged to put his wife and children, whom he left at Rome, into a poor lodging which he hired for them, in order that he might let his own house for the remainder of the year; and he pawned a pearl taken from his mother's ear-ring, to defray his expenses on the road. A crowd of creditors who were waiting to stop him, and amongst them the people of Sineussa and Formia, whose taxes he had converted to his own use, he eluded, by alarming them with the apprehension of false accusations. He had, however, sued a certain freedman, who was clamorous in demanding a debt of him, under pretence that he had kicked him; which action he would not withdraw, until he had wrung from the freedman fifty thousand sesterces. Upon his arrival in the province, the army, which was disaffected to Galba, and ripe for insurrection, received him with open arms, as if he had been sent them from heaven. It was no small recommendation to their favour, that he was the son of a man who had been thrice consul, was in the prime of life, and of an easy, prodigal disposition. This opinion, which had been long entertained of him, Vitellius confirmed by some late practices; having kissed all the common soldiers whom he met with upon the road, and been excessively complaisant in the inns and stables to the muleteers and travellers; asking them in a morning, if they had got their breakfasts, and letting them see, by belching, that he had eaten his.[^6dd1fb6510a04253aece5c222c021ce3]

### A story by E. T. Merrill about Formiae from Commentary on Catullus



55\. A few of the persons distinguished by the love or by the hatred of Catullus may conveniently be mentioned here. Some such persons, however, as Caesar, Cicero, and Clodius, are so well known otherwise to the ordinary reader as to need no biographical notice in a work of this sort. Others, like Lesbia, nave been sufficiently noticed in previous paragraphs of this Introduction. Still others are of so little present importance, or are so little known to us outside the mention of them by Catullus, that the brief references to them in the commentary on the individual poems may suffice. The names of all these, with references to the poems in which they are addressed or mentioned, may be found in the Index of Proper Names at the end of this volume.

56\. It is a temptation to identify the Alfenus to whom the remonstrance of c. 30 is addressed with P. Alfenus Varus, consul suffectus 39 B.C., especially if he, in turn, can be identified with the Alfenus Varus who protected Vergil's property at Mantua (Ecl. 1, 6, 9), who was perhaps a native of Cremona (though falsely identified by the scholiasts on Horace with Alfenus vafer of Sat. 1.3.130). For if Varus was at Cremona during the winter and spring of 55-54 B.C., while Catullus was at Verona (cf. § 40), we perhaps have a key to the difference in tone between c. 30 and c. 38. From Cornificius at Rome the poet could expect in his growing illness only written comfort, and that is all he asks. Alfenus Varus at Cremona was within easy reaching distance of Verona by a direct highway, the Via Postumia, and might have visited Catullus in person, but did not. Hence the deeper feeling of slight with which Catullus addresses him.

57\. The 'Pollio frater' of c. 12.6 is very likely the only Pollio known to us from this period, C. Asinius, Cn. f. (born 75 B.C., died 5 A.D.), who became praetor in 45 B.C. and consul in 40, in which year he gained a triumph over the Parthini. At first a Caesarian, he might have been won over to the senatorial party after Caesar's death, but finally cast in his lot with Antonius, from whom, however, he became alienated, but without entering the circle of the intimate friends of Augustus. As orator, dramatic and lyric poet, historian of the first triumvirate, and literary critic, he gained lasting fame, and is frequently quoted by succeeding writers. Among his intimate friends were Vergil and Horace; cf. Verg. Ecl. 3.84; 4; 8.6; Hor. Carm. II. 1; Sat. 1.10.42, 85.

58\. Nothing further is known of the older brother of Pollio addressed in c. 12. The family of the Asinii sprang from Teate, the capital of the Marrucini, but it is doubtful whether Marrucine in c. 12.1 is simply a distinguishing epithet. C. Asinius Pollio is the first of the family known to bear a cognomen, and perhaps that custom was introduced in his generation, his elder brother taking the cognomen Marrucinus from the seat of the family.

59\. The Caelius of c. 58 is probably identical with the Caelius of cc. 82 and 100, and with the Rufus of cc. 69 and 77 (and also cc. 73 and 59?), the names and circumstances suggesting M. Caelius Rufus, born, according to Pliny (N.H 7.165), on the same day with C. Licinius Calvus, May 28, 82 B.C. (though perhaps this date is too late, by a few years, for the birth of Caelius). Caelius is well known as an ambitious politician and an orator (Cic. Brut. 79.273; Quint. Inst. VI. 3.69; X. 1. 115; 2.25; Tac. Dial. 18, 21, 25). He was at first a partisan of the optimates; but after filling the offices of tribune (52 B.C.), quaestor, and curule aedile (50 B.C.), and contracting immense debts by his extravagant life, he became a follower of Caesar, and was by him made praetor for the year 48. But being shortly thereafter deposed for attempts at revolutionary legislation, he tried to seduce certain of Caesar's troops, and was finally killed under the walls of Thurii. He was an active and interesting correspondent of Cicero, by whom he was defended (56 B.C.) in the famous speech pro Caelio against the charge of attempted poisoning brought by Clodia (Lesbia), whose favored lover he had been. He himself appears to have broken this connection, and perhaps to have opened the eyes of Catullus to Lesbia's real character, after which the friend-ship was again cemented between him and Catullus which had been severed by their rivalry (cf. §§ 25, 26). The poems addressed to him were apparently written in about the following order: cc. 100, 82, 77, (73), 69, (59), 58

60\. C. Licinius Macer Calvus, apparently the most intimate friend of Catullus, was the son of the annalist, Licinius Macer and was born May 28, 82 B.C. (cf. Plin. l.c.). He died in, or not very long before, the year 47 B.C. (cf. Cic. Fam. XV. 21.4). He was renowned as a most able and skilful orator, though of low stature (cf. 53.5; Sen. Contr. VII. 4.7; Ov. Trist. II.431), and as a writer of epic, lyric, and epigram (cf. Cic. Brut. 279, 283; Tac. Dial.18; Quint. Inst. 10.1.115; Plin. Ep. I. 16. 5; Gell. XIX. 9.7; Serv. on Verg. Ecl. 6.47; 8.4) - On account of his intimacy with Catullus and the similarity of their political principles (cf. Suet. Iul. 73) and of their writings they are often named together (cf. with above Hor. Sat. I. 10. 19, and indexes to Propertius and Ovid). The few extant fragments of his works are appended to the editions of Catullus by Lachmann and L. Muiller. The death of Quintilia, apparently from the tone of c.96 the wife of Calvus, gave occasion for one of the finest and most touching of the briefer poems of Catullus.

61\. The Cornificius to whom Catullus addressed the pathetic appeal of c. 38 was a poet (cf. vv. 7 and 8), and is doubtless to be identified with the Cornificius mentioned by Ovid (Trist. II.436) in connection with other verse-writers of the period of Catullus. It is not so clear, though quite possible, that he is the Q. Cornificius to whom Cicero wrote friendly letters (Fam. XII. 17-30), dated between 45 and 43 B.C. This Cornificius was an active officer of Julius Caesar, a member of the college of augurs, and later governor of the province of Africa, which he endeavored to hold against T. Sextius, the general of the second triumvirate. His death is mentioned by Jerome under date of 41 B.C.: Cornificius poeta a militibus desertus interiit, quos saepe fugientes 'galeatos lepores' adpellarat. Jerome If this be the friend of Catullus, he may perhaps be counted as another of the group of young writers won over by Caesar from the ranks of his political foes. His interest and activity in rhetorical studies are distinctly indicated by Cicero, and there seems to be no good reason to doubt that he is the Cornificius rhetor not infrequently quoted by Quintilian. With but slightly less probability may be attributed to him the work on the derivation of the names of the gods ascribed by Macrobius and Priscian to an author of his name: but the verse in criticism of a grammatical point in Vergil attributed by Cledonius (V. 43.2) to Cornificius Gallus may have been written, as some have thought, by Cornelius Gallus. Only two fragments of the verses of Cornificius have been preserved, one a hendecasyllabic (Macr. VI. 4. 12), and the other the latter part of a hexameter from his Glaucus (Macr. VI. 5. 13). They are appended by L. Müller to his edition of Catullus.

62\. The Cato to whom c. 56 is addressed was probably not that pattern of ancient Roman strictness, M. Porcius Cato, later called Uticensis, but the grammarian, Valenus Cato, who was a countryman of Catullus (Suet. Gram. I i), and whose amatory poems are mentioned by Ovid (Trist. II.436) in connection with those of Cinna (cf. § 63), Cornificius (cf. § 61), and Anser.

63\. C. Helvius Cinna, a companion of Catullus on the staff of Memmius (cf. c. 10.30 and § 30), whose epic poem, the Zmyrna, is praised in c. 95, was probably the Caesarian tribune mistaken for L. Cornelius Cinna, the anti-Caesarian, in the riots attending the funeral of Julius Caesar, and killed by the populace (Plut. Brut. 20, Iul.68; Suet. Iul.85; cf. Shakspere Jul. Caes.III. 3). The insignificant extant fragments of his poems are appended by L. Muller to his edition of Catullus.

64\. The Cornelius of c. 1.1 seems to be Cornelius Nepos, the historian; witness Ausonius, who says (XXIII. 1-3) 'Cui ... libellum' Veronensis ait poeta quondam, inventoque dedit statim Nepoti . Nepos (circ. 94-24 B.C.) was certainly a provincial from Cisalpine Gaul ( Plin. N. H. 3.127 Nepos Padi accola ), and probably a native of Ticinum (Plin. Ep. IV. 28.1; Mommsen in Hermes III. p.62). His acquaintance with Catullus, though nothing certain can be traced concerning it was doubtless fostered by their similarity of origin (cf. § 12). Nepos was author not only of the work De Viris Illustribus, of which a part, with lives of Cato and of Atticus, is still extant, but also of other historical works (cf. c. 1.6 n.) and of poems (Plin. Ep. V. 3. 6).

65\. Q. Hortensius Ortulus (114-50 B.C.), Cicero>'s greatest rival as an orator, was also somewhat of a historian (Vell. II. 16. 3), and wrote erotic poems (Ov. Trist. II.441; Plin. Ep. V. 3. 5), which the Greeks at the banquet of Antonius Julianus (Gell. XIX. 9.7) characterized as invenusta, though they admitted that Catullus and Calvus wrote some verses comparable with those of Anacreon. Presuming, perhaps, upon his own gifts as a poet, Hortensius asked Catullus for a poem (c. 65.18-19), and the poet complied with the request, though with an absence of compliment that indicates no intimate friendship with his petitioner, whose much greater age and high position gave him, however, the power to become an influential patron. That the friendship made no progress seems to be indicated by the uncomplimentary allusion to the verses of Hortensius in c. 95.3 (cf. however § 25 ad fin.).

66\. The Varus of c. 10 is apparently identical with the Varus of c. 22, who is a friend of Catullus and a critic of poetry, if not a poet himself. This may well be the distinguished Quintilius Varus, the Augustan critic (Hor. AP. 438 ff.) and poet (Acro and Comm. Cruq. on l.c.). He is called a native of Cremona; and his death in 23 B.C. (according to Jerome) drew from Horace a touching address of sympathy to Vergil (Carm. 1.24). Judged from the tone of the passage in the Ars Poetica , Quintilius must have been somewhat older than Horace, while yet he could hardly have been born long, if at all, before Catullus. The attempt to identify the Varus of c. 10 and c. 2 with Alfenus Varus of c. 30 is unsatisfactory.

67\. The Manlius Torquatus, whose marriage with Vinia Aurunculeia is celebrated in c. 61, was perhaps the L. Manlius Torquatus whose father was consul in 65 B.C. (cf. Hor. Carm. III.21., Epod. 13.6), and who was himself praetor in 49. He allied himself with the Pompeians, and was killed in Africa in 47 (cf. Bell. Afr. 96). In 62 B.C. Manlius prosecuted P. Cornelius Sulla on the charge of conspiracy with Catiline. Cicero and Hortensius appeared for the defence and secured an acquittal. In Cicero's speech on that occasion (Pro Sulla), and especially in his Brutus (76. 265), Manlius is highly praised.

68\. A certain Veranius is mentioned in cc. 12, 28, and 47 in connection with a Fabullus, evidently an intimate friend of his, as both were of Catullus. Beside these three references to them jointly, c. 9 is addressed to Veranius alone, and c. 13 to Fabullus alone, the equal recognition thus scrupulously given them by Catullus suggesting the existence of a close bond of intimacy between the two friends. Nothing more is known of them than can be gathered from Catullus himself. Veranius has in c. 9 just returned from a residence in Spain, and in c. 12 the presence there of Fabullus also is noted. The 13th poem, too, a jesting reference to a prospective dinner offered Fabullus, appears to have been written while Fabullus was absent somewhere, or had just returned, and may well refer to the same occasion as c. 9, the different tone of the individual poems, one sportive, and one affectionate, corresponding to characteristic differences in the dispositions of the two friends. In cc. 28 and 47 Veranius and Fabullus have been away from Rome as members of the retinue of a certain Piso, a provincial governor. They returned to Rome apparently not long after the time of the return of Catullus himself from Bithynia (56 B.C.; cf. § 31 ff.).

69\. If, then, there be such a connection as indicated between cc. 9 and 13, the absence in Spain cannot have been that with Piso, and must have preceded it by several years; for the reference to Lesbia in c. 13.11 clearly antedates the break of Catullus with her, and that occurred before his journey to Bithynia. But it is not incredible that two friends so intimately connected as Veranius and Fabullus should have been together on more than one journey after fortune; and the journey to Spain like the later one with Piso (cf. § 70) may well have been on the staff of a provincial governor, - probably about 60 B.C., as the reference to Lesbia indicates (cf c. 13.11 n.).

70\. The Piso unfavorably commented upon in cc. 28 and 47 (cf. § 68) is probably L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul in 58 B.C. (the year of Cicero's exile), and in 57-55 governor of Macedonia, where he made an honorable record. After his return to Rome in 55 B.C. he attempted to reply to certain strictures of Cicero uttered in his absence, and drew down upon himself the overwhelming invective power of his adversary in the famous speech In Pisonem, in which the whole life, character, and actions of Piso were held up to undeserved obloquy.

71\. The service of Catullus on the staff of C. Memmius, governor of Bithynia, has already been discussed (§ 29 ff.). Concerning Memmius himself we may add further that neither his political nor his personal character was above reproach. He was in 54 B.C. party to a most barefaced attempt to secure the consulship by bribing the consuls of that year (Cic. Att. IV. 18. 2), and was charged with the seduction of the wives of Lucullus (Cic. Att. I. 18. 3) and Pompey (Suet. Gram 14). He appears to better advantage as a scholar and the patron of literary men, especially of Lucretius, who dedicated his great poem to him. Cicero (Brut. 70.247) speaks well of his Greek scholarship, and of his ability in oratory, though blaming him for lack of application. Accused of ambitus in 53 B.C., on account of the operations of the preceding year, he went into exile in Greece (cf. Cic. Fam. XIII.1), where he died about the year 49.

72\. Prominent among the invective poems of Catullus is a group directed against a certain Gellius. This comprises cc. 74, 80, 88, 89, 90, 91, 116, but the poems are not arranged in chronological order. Apparently the earliest in composition is c. 16, and the second c. 91,-- the first indicating that Catullus had tried to avert the hostility of Gellius by sending him translations from Callimachus, but declaring from that time open war, while the second asserts that Gellius had broken the bond of friendship with Catullus by becoming a lover of Lesbia. In c. 80.1 the youth of Gellius is indicated, and in all the series except c. 116 he is charged with various abhorrent crimes. The most acceptable suggestion of his identity was originally made by Pantagathus († 1578), who judged him to be that son of L. Gellius Publicola (consul 72 B.C.) who is said by Valerius Maximus (V. 9.1) to have been accused before the senate of in novercam (cf. c. 88.1, etc.) commissum stuprum et parricidium cogitatum. This younger Gellius was himself consul in 36 B.C., and his age therefore also accords with the intimations of Catullus. The patruus of c. 74 is identified by some critics with the Gellius Publicola attacked by Cicero in Pro Sestio 51. 110, while yet others have supposed, but with no sufficient reason, that this Gellius, and not the one of Valerius Maximus, is the Gellius assailed by Catullus.

73\. The attacks of Catullus upon Mamurra have already been mentioned (§ 38). That he is identical with the 'Mentula' of cc. 94, 105, 114, and 115 we may be tolerably certain on noting the use of that name for Mamurra in c. 29.13, and on comparing the wealth and extravagance of the two men (cc. 114 and 115 with cc. 29, 41, and 43), their literary pretensions (c. 105 with c. 57.7), and their licentiousness (cc. 94 and 115.7-8 with cc. 29.7-8 and 57) - These latter indications, however, but support that of c. 29.13, and would not independently establish the identity.

74\. A sufficient biography of Mamurra is given by Pliny (N. H. XXXVI. 6.48), who says he was an eques of Formiae and praefectus fabrum of Caesar in Gaul, and quotes Nepos as authority for the statement that Mamurra first of the Romans incrusted the entire walls of his house on the Caelian with marble, and had within it none but solid marble columns. Cicero, too, mentions Mamurra's ill-gotten wealth (Att. VII. 7.6), and in Att.XIII. 52. 1 (written in 45 B.C.) refers to the calm way in which Caesar received news of his death (so Nipperdey interprets the allusion). The connection of Mamurra with the provincial Ameana (cc. 41, 43) may be assigned to the time when he was in attendance upon Caesar in his winter journeys to the nearer province.

75\. The poet Volusius of cc. 36 and 95 is probably not to be identified with Tanusius Geminus, as Muretus and other later writers would have it. The only ground for such identification is a remark made by Seneca ( Ep. 93.11 annales Tanusii scis quam ponderosi sint et quid vocentur ). But of all the names that appear in Catullus, Lesbia and Lesbius are the only ones known to be pseudonyms (for Mentula is hardly a name, but an easily recognized epithet). And the quid vocentur of Seneca may readily refer to some other popular characterization of the work of the annalist, and not to the cacata charta of c. 36.1.[^d5f4b0ec47434a40a4083b3a97497892]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Cosa from Against Verres



He thanks the men and praises their good-will and diligence in his behalf. He himself, inflamed with wickedness and frenzy, comes into the forum. His eyes glared; cruelty was visible in his whole countenance. All men waited to see what does he was going to take,—what he was going to do; when all of a sudden he orders the man to be seized, and to be stripped and bound in the middle of the forum, and the rods to be got ready. The miserable man cried out that he was a Roman citizen, a citizen, also, of the municipal town of Cosa,—that he had served with Lucius Pretius a most illustrious Roman knight, who was living as a trader at Panormus, and from whom Verres might know that he was speaking the truth. Then Verres says that he has ascertained that he had been sent into Sicily by the leaders of the runaway slaves, in order to act as a spy; a matter as to which there was no witness, no trace, nor even the slightest suspicion in the mind of any one.[^256382681e0a42eb8f6a5127db799874]

In the meantime Milo, having despatched letters to all the colonies and free towns, intimating that what he did was in virtue of Pompey's authority, who had sent him orders by Bibulus, endeavored to draw over the debtors to his party. But not succeeding in his design, he contented himself with setting some slaves at liberty, and with them marched to besiege Cosa, in the territory of Turinum. Q. Paedius the pretor, with a garrison of one legion, commanded in the town: and here Milo was slain by a stone from a machine on the walls. Caelius giving out that he was gone to Caesar, came to Thurium, where endeavouring to debauch the inhabitants, and corrupt by promises of money the Spanish and Gaulish horse, whom Caesar had sent thither to garrison the place, they slew him. Thus these dangerous beginnings, that by reason of the multiplicity of affairs wherewith the magistrates were distracted, and the ticklish situation of the times, threatened great revolutions, and alarmed all Italy, were brought to a safe and speedy issue.[^1d75c945cc6640dab853dcc65018edef]

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Cosa from Divus Vespasianus



Vespasian was born in the country of the Sabines, between the Reate, and a little country-seat called Phalacrine, upon the fifth of the calends of December [27th November], in the evening, in the consulship of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus and Caius Poppaeus Sabinus, five years before the death of Augustus;^[A.U.C. 762. A.D. 10] and was educated under the care of Tertulla, his grandmother by the father's side, upon an estate belonging to the family, at Cosa.^[Cosa was a place in the Volscian territory; of which Anagni was probably the chief town. It lies about forty miles to the north-east of Rome.] After his advancement to the empire, he used frequently to visit the place where he had spent his infancy; and the villa was continued in the same condition, that he might see every thing about him just as he had been used to do. And he had so great a regard for the memory of his grandmother, that, upon solemn occasions and festival days, he constantly drank out of a silver cup which she had been accustomed to use. After assuming the manly habit, he had a long time a distaste for the senatorian toga, though his brother had obtained it- nor could he be persuaded by any one but his mother to sue for that badge of honour. She at length drove him to it, more by taunts and reproaches, than by entreaties and authority, calling him now and then, by way of reproach, his brother's footman. He served as military tribune in Thrace. When made quaestor, the province of Crete and Cyrene fell to him by lot. He was candidate for the aedileship, and soon after for the praetorship, but met with a repulse in the former case; though at last, with much difficulty, he came in sixth on the poll-books. But the office of praetor he carried upon his first canvass, standing amongst the highest at the poll. Being incensed against the senate, and desirous to gain, by all possible means, the good graces of Caius,^[Caligula] he obtained leave to exhibit extraordinary^[These games were extraordinary, as being out of the usual course of those given by praetors. ] games for the emperor's victory in Germany, and advised them to increase the punishment of the conspirators against his life, by exposing their corpses unburied. He likewise gave him thanks in that august assembly for the honour of being admitted to his table.[^5c52dfddac4e4995a693579881197090]

### A story by Pausanias, fl. ca. 150-175 about Pisae from Description of Greece



Enough of my discussion of this question. Heracles afterwards took Elis and sacked it, with an army he had raised of Argives, Thebans and Arcadians. The Eleans were aided by the men of Pisa and of Pylus in Elis. The men of Pylus were punished by Heracles, but his expedition against Pisa was stopped by an oracle from Delphi to this effectMy father cares for Pisa, but to me in the hollows of Pytho.^[Hermann's emendation would mean: "but unto me be assigned Pytho."]This oracle proved the salvation of Pisa. To Phyleus Heracles gave up the land of Elis and all the rest, more out of respect for Phyleus than because he wanted to do so: he allowed him to keep the prisoners, and Augeas to escape punishment.

The women of Elis, it is said, seeing that their land had been deprived of its vigorous manhood, prayed to Athena that they might conceive at their first union with their husbands. Their prayer was answered, and they set up a sanctuary of Athena surnamed Mother. Both wives and husbands were so delighted at their union that they named the place itself, where they first met, Bady (sweet), and the river that runs thereby Bady Water, this being a word of their native dialect.

When Phyleus had returned to Dulichium after organizing the affairs of Elis, Augeas died at an advanced age, and the kingdom of Elis devolved on Agasthenes, the son of Augeas, and on Amphimachus and Thalpius. For the sons of Actor married twin sisters, the daughters of Dexamenus who was king at Olenus; Amphimachus was born to one son and Theronice, Thalpius to her sister Theraephone and Eurytus.

However, neither Amarynceus himself nor his son Diores remained common people. Incidentally this is shown by Homer^[Hom. Il. 2.622] in his list of the Eleans; he makes their whole fleet to consist of forty ships, half of them under the command of Amphimachus and Thalpius, and of the remaining twenty he puts ten under Diores, the son of Amarynceus, and ten under Polyxenus, the son of Agasthenes. Polyxenus came back safe from Troy and begat a son, Amphimachus. This name I think Polyxenus gave his son because of his friendship with Amphimachus, the son of Cteatus, who died at Troy.

Amphimachus begat Eleius, and it was while Eleius was king in Elis that the assembly of the Dorian army under the sons of Aristomachus took place, with a view to returning to the Peloponnesus. To their kings was delivered this oracle, that they were to choose the "one with three eyes" to lead them on their return. When they were at a loss as to the meaning of the oracle, they were met by a man driving a mule, which was blind of one eye.

Cresphontes inferred that this was the man indicated by the oracle, and so the Dorians made him one of themselves. He urged them to descend upon the Peloponnesus in ships, and not to attempt to go across the Isthmus with a land army. Such was his advice, and at the same time he led them on the voyage from Naupactus to Molycrium. In return they agreed to give him at his request the land of Elis. The man was Oxylus, son of Haemon, the son of Thoas. This was the Thoas who helped the sons of Atreus to destroy the empire of Priam, and from Thoas to Aetolus the son of Endymion are six generations.

There were ties of kindred between the Heracleidae and the kings of Aetolia; in particular the mothers of Thoas, the son of Andraemon, and of Hyllus, the son of Heracles, were sisters. It fell to the lot of Oxylus to be an outlaw from Aetolia. The story goes that as he was throwing the quoit he missed the mark and committed unintentional homicide. The man killed by the quoit, according to one account, was Thermius, the brother of Oxylus; according to another it was Alcidocus, the son of Scopius.[^8796a0bdc8da48028e08ea2b60683154]

Virgil departed from Pisae, intending to travel by ship, down the coast to Luna, a 36.177462362 mile journey. 

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Nor found they room for hope; for nature gave  
Unerring portents of worse ills to come.  
The angry gods filled earth and air and sea  
With frequent prodigies; in darkest nights  
Strange constellations sparkled through the gloom:  
The pole was all afire, and torches flew  
Across the depths of heaven; with horrid hair  
A blazing comet stretched from east to west  
And threatened change to kingdoms. From the blue  
Pale lightning flashed, and in the murky air  
The fire took divers shapes; a lance afar  
Would seem to quiver or a misty torch;  
A noiseless thunderbolt from cloudless sky  
Rushed down, and drawing fire in northern parts  
Plunged on the summit of the Alban mount.  
The stars that run their courses in the void  
Of night, came forth at noontide, and the moon  
Whose orb complete gave back her brother's rays,  
Hid by the shade of earth, grew pale and wan.  
The sun himself, when poised in mid career,  
Shrouded his burning car in blackest gloom  
And plunged the world in darkness, so that men  
Despaired of day-like as he veiled his light  
From that fell banquet^[Compare Ben Jonson's ' Catiline,' I. 1: Lecca. The day goes back, Or else my senses. Cirius. As at Atreus' feast.] which Mycenae saw.  
The day goes back,  
Or else my senses.  
As at Atreus' feast.  
The jaws of Etna were agape with flame  
That rose not heavenwards, but headlong fell  
In smoking stream upon th' Italian flank.  
Then black Charybdis, from her boundless depth,  
Threw up a gory sea. In piteous tones  
Howled the wild dogs; the Vestal fire was snatched  
From off the altar; and the flame that crowned  
The Latin festival was split in twain,  
As on the Theban pyre,^[When the Theban brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, were being burned on the same pyre, the flame shot up in two separate tongues, indicating that even in death they could not be reconciled. (Mr. Haskins' note, citing Statius, 'Theb.')] in ancient days;  
Earth tottered on its base: the mighty Alps  
From off their summits shook th' eternal snow.^['Shook the old snow from off their trembling laps.' (Marlowe.) The Latin word is jugis.]  
In huge upheaval Ocean raised his waves  
O'er Calpe's rock and Atlas' hoary head.  
The native gods shed tears, and holy sweat  
Dropped from the idols; gifts in temples fell:  
Foul birds defiled the day; beasts left the woods  
And made their lair among the streets of Rome.  
All this we hear; nay more: dumb oxen spake;  
Monsters were brought to birth and mothers shrieked  
At their own offspring; words of dire import  
From Cumae's prophetess were noised abroad.  
Bellona's priests with bleeding arms, and slaves  
Of Cybele's worship, with ensanguined hair,  
Howled chants of havoc and of woe to men.  
Arms clashed; and sounding in the pathless woods  
Were heard strange voices; spirits walked the earth:  
And dead men's ashes muttered from the urn.  
Those who live near the walls desert their homes,  
For lo! with hissing serpents in her hair,  
Waving in downward whirl a blazing pine,  
A fiend patrols the town, like that which erst  
At Thebes urged on Agave,^[Book VI., 420.] or which hurled  
Lycurgus' bolts, or that which as he came  
From Hades seen, at haughty Juno's word,  
Brought terror to the soul of Hercules.  
Trumpets like those that summon armies forth  
Were heard re-echoing in the silent night:  
And from the earth arising Sulla's^[Sulla was buried in the Campus Martius. (Plutarch, ' Sulla,'38.) The corpse of Marius was dragged from his tomb by Sulla's order, and thrown into the Anio.] ghost  
Sang gloomy oracles, and by Anio's wave  
All fled the homesteads, frighted by the shade  
Of Marius waking from his broken tomb.  
In such dismay they summon, as of yore,  
The Tuscan sages to the nation's aid.  
Aruns, the eldest, leaving his abode  
In desolate Luca,^[It would seem that Luna is the better reading. (Dante, ' Inferno,'xx. 46.] came, well versed in all  
The lore of omens; knowing what may mean  
The flight of hovering bird, the pulse that beats  
In offered victims, and the levin bolt.  
All monsters first, by most unnatural birth  
Brought into being, in accursed flames  
He bids consume. Then round the walls of Rome^[Such a ceremonial took place in A.D. 56 under Nero, after the temples of Jupiter and Minerva had been struck by lightning, and was probably witnessed by Lucan himself. (See Merivale's 'History of the Roman Empire,' chapter lii.)]  
Each trembling citizen in turn proceeds.  
The priests, chief guardians of the public faith,  
With holy sprinkling purge the open space  
That borders on the wall; in sacred garb  
Follows the lesser crowd: the Vestals come  
By priestess led with laurel crown bedecked,  
To whom alone is given the right to see  
Minerva's effigy that came from Troy.^[See Book IX., 1177.]  
Next come the keepers of the sacred books  
And fate's predictions; who from Almo's brook  
Bring back Cybebe laved; the augur too  
Taught to observe sinister flight of birds;  
And those who serve the banquets to the gods;  
And Titian brethren; and the priest of Mars,  
Proud of the buckler that adorns his neck;  
By him the Flamen, on his noble head  
The cap of office. While they tread the path  
That winds around the walls, the aged seer  
Collects the thunderbolts that fell from heaven,  
And lays them deep in earth, with muttered words  
Naming the spot accursed. Next a steer,  
Picked for his swelling neck and beauteous form,  
He leads to the altar, and with slanting knife  
Spreads on his brow the meal, and pours the wine.  
The victim's struggles prove the gods averse;  
But when the servers press upon his horns  
He bends the knee and yields him to the blow.  
No crimson torrent issues at the stroke,  
But from the wound a dark empoisoned stream  
Ebbs slowly downward. Aruns at the sight  
Aghast, upon the entrails of the beast  
Essayed to read the anger of the gods.  
Their very colour terrified the seer;  
Spotted they were and pale, with sable streaks  
Of lukewarm gore bespread; the liver damp  
With foul disease, and on the hostile part  
The angry veins defiant; of the lungs  
The fibre hid, and through the vital parts  
The membrane small; the heart has ceased to throb;  
Blood oozes through the ducts; the caul is split:  
And, fatal omen of impending ill,  
One lobe o'ergrows the other; of the twain  
The one lies flat and sick, the other beats  
And keeps the pulse in rapid strokes astir.  
Disaster's near approach thus learned, he cries-  
' Whatever may be the purpose of the gods,  
' Tis not for me to tell; this offered beast  
' Not Jove possesses, but the gods below.  
' We dare not speak our fears, yet fear doth make  
' The future worse than fact. May all the gods  
' Prosper the tokens, and the sacrifice  
' Be void of truth, and Tages (famous seer)^[Tages. A dwarf, with the figure of a child, but with grey hairs, ploughed up by a peasant near Tarquinii. He betrayed the secrets of Etruscan lore and straightway died. (Mommsen, vol. i. p. 190; Dennis, 'Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria,' vol. i. p. 373.)]  
' Have vainly taught these mysteries.' Such his words  
Involved, mysterious.

### A story by John Conington about Parma from Commentary on Vergil's Aeneid, Volume 2



Heyne thinks this line spurious, and Ribbeck, following the Parma edition, inserts it after v. 641. But it is natural that the Capitol should be represented with the accessories familiar to a Roman, whether they formed a part of the historical scene or not (see two last notes), and Virg. doubtless meant to note Vulcan's art in giving the effect of the strawbuilt shed in gold, just as in Il. 18. 548, 9 we are told that the blackness of the ploughed land was represented in gold. Gossrau observes rightly of the commentators, Non animadverterunt non historiam narrari sed describi rem inenarrabilem. Recens refers to the freshness and sharpness of Vulcan's work; but it also alludes to the constant renovation of the casa Romuli in the historical times of Rome, attested by Dionys. Ant. 1. 79. Vitruv. 2. 1 and other writers agree with Virg. in placing Romulus' hut on the Capitol: Dionys. l. c. puts it ἐκ τοῦ Παλαντίου ἐπὶ τῆς πρὸς τὸν ἱππόδρουον στρεφούσης λαγόνος. For the different ways of reconciling or getting rid of this discrepancy see Lewis pp. 238 foll. His own explanation, that there were two luts, is hardly supported by the parallel he urges of duplicate relics preserved in offerent places, as there rivalry comes in as a motive for multiplying memorials, which cannot have been the case in Rome with its state religion: it is strange too that the fact of the existence of two should not have been mentioned by any ancient writer. Romuleo again points to the renovation, which kept the hut as it was in Romulus' days, while at the same time we are meant to think of Romulea or Romuli regia, the hut being all that romulus had for his palace. Lewis' view seems to be supported by H. Jordan, Hermes 7, p. 193 foll.[^2c1673e228a448fd93b2f4f57c75eeab]

### A story by Cicero, Marcus Tullius about Mutina from Philippics



But since it is not only courage but wisdom also which is expected from this order (although these qualities appear scarcely possible to be separated, still let us separate them here), courage bids us fight, inflames our just hatred, urges us to the conflict, summons us to danger. What says wisdom? She uses more cautious counsels, she is provident for the future, she is in every respect more on the defensive. What then does she think? for we must obey her, and we are bound to consider that the best thing which is arranged in the most prudent manner. If she enjoins me to think nothing of more consequence than my life, not to fight at the risk of my life, but to avoid all danger, I will then ask her whether I am also to become a slave when I have obeyed all these injunction? If she says, yes; I for one will not listen to that Wisdom, however learned she may be; but if the answer is, Preserve your life and your safety, Preserve your fortune, "Preserve your estate, still, however, considering all these things of less value than liberty; therefore enjoy these things if you can do so consistently with the freedom of the republic, and do not abandon liberty for them, but sacrifice them for liberty, as proofs of the injury you have sustained;"—then I shall think that I really am listening to the voice of Wisdom, and I will obey her as a god.[^e29dca2f0d0e4fa5b007ea6b5c94d059]

### A story by E. T. Merrill about Verona from Commentary on Catullus



This pasquinade, in the form of a conversation between the poet and the door of a certain house, abounds in difficulties of interpretation for us, though its directness of personal reference must have made it clear enough to the Veronese. Its tone of familiarity with, and personal interest in, the tittle-tattle of the city seems to indicate that it was composed before Catullus left Verona to live at Rome, and not during one of his brief visits to his old home. The motive is apparently as follows (see also later notes): The Door is that of a house in Verona (v. 34), formerly owned by an aged (v. 4) bachelor or widower (v. 6) named Balbus, after whose death (v. 6) it came into the possession of his son (v. 1) Caecilius, who thereupon married (v. 6) and brought home a young and lively widow (v. 20) from Brixia (v. 32), who claimed to be also a maid (v. 19). Strange rumors about her life soon began to spread through Verona, and the poet inquires of the Door why it has betrayed its master's confidence (presumably by letting in lovers to corrupt the young wife). The Door defends itself by saying that it has not betrayed its trust, but the woman was a bad lot before she came to Verona, and the current gossip is true of the period of her former marriage; for though her husband was notoriously impotent, his father stepped in to fill the son's place in the household, and the woman moreover was too intimate with certain other people named and hinted at. The proof of this culpability is found not only in rumors that have followed her from Brixia, but in her own familiar talk with her maids in the presence of the Door, which she treated as if it could neither hear nor speak.—The conception of the door as a bar in the way of would-be lovers is familiar enough in ancient poetry (cf. Catul. 63.65 and Plautus, Horace, Ovid, Propertius, etc. passim); Propertius (Prop. 1.16ff.) also represents the door as speaking of its experiences.

The poet speaks: You have been the trusted servant of the newly-made husband (Caecilius), as you were of his father (Balbus); the latter you served faithfully (vv. 3, 4); now that he is dead (v. 6) you know well what he would wish you to do (v. 5 voto), but you have wilfully disregarded it (servisse maligne), and have entirely changed (v. 7 mutata) your character; why have you thus abandoned your former habit of fidelity to your master's interests (v. 8)?

dulci viro: cf. Catul. 66.33 dulci coniuge .

teque: etc. cf. the formal expression in the invocation of Scipio, Liv. 29.27 ea vos omnia bene iuvetis, bonis auctibus auxitis .

bona ope: cf. Catul. 34.23 bona ope .

auctet: the word apparently occurs only here and in Pl. Amph. 6 bono atque amplo auctare lucro , and Lucr. 1.56 unde omnis natura creet res, auctet, alatque .

ipse senex: the aged master, in contrast to his son and heir.

rursus: on the contrary; cf. Catul. 22.11

voto servisse maligne: observe the emphatic contrast to v. 3 Balbo servisse benigne.

porrecto: sc. in death; cf. Prop. 2.8.33 viderat informem multa Patroclon harena porrectum .

marita: i.e. you have come into the possession of a married couple (Balbus having been, therefore, a bachelor or a widower); cf. Liv. 27.31.5 vagabatur per maritas domos; and on the other hand such phrases as Catul. 68.6 in lecto caelibe .

agedum: cf. Catul. 63.78.

ita Caecilio placeam: the Door is sincere in its desire to be faithful to the husband, Caecilius, and to be acquitted in his sight, for it evidently views him as sinned against by a designing and criminal wife; cf. 20 ff n.

pote: see Catul. 17.24n.

See Crit. App.

qui … omnes: apparently referring to v. 12 populi.

quacumque: sc. ratione, modifying factum.

non satis: etc., the poet suggests that a categorical denial is not enough, but convincing proof of innocence should be offered.

nos … nobis: referring to the speaker only, as in v.7.

virgo: etc., i. e. to be sure, though a widow, she passed herself off as a maid, and every one knew that she might well be so as far as her husband was concerned.

nobis: the Door unites interests with the injured husband against the guilty wife.

vir prior: carefully to distinguish her weakling husband from Caecilius.

attigerit: subjunctive of concession.

tenera beta: so Augustus is said (Suet. Oct. 87) to have used betissare for languere.

sicula: ἅπαξ λεγόμενον

illius: elsewhere in Catullus this and similar genitives have the penult short.

conscelerasse domum: cf. Catul. 64.404 divos scelerare parentes , also of unnatural crime.

iners sterili semine: on the repetition of idea in the adjectives cf. Catul. 64.64, Catul. 64.103, Catul. 64.221; Catul. 90.5; and (with Ellis) v. 48.

zonam: etc. cf. Catul. 2.13n.

Brixia: the modern Brescia, the capital of the (Gallic) Cenomani (Liv. 32.30). It is about as far to the westward of Sirmio as Verona is to the eastward (one half-hour by rail). —The remainder of the verse is involved in great difficulty; it might naturally be taken to refer to the situation of Brixia at the base of a hill, but suppositum is apparently not used elsewhere in the sense of 'lying at the foot of,' and no hill in the neighborhood of Brixia is called by a name resembling chinea till about A.D. 1500, when this passage from Catullus might have influenced local nomenclature (cf. the case of the Grampian Hills).

praecurrit Mella: the Mella (cf. Verg. G. 4.278 curva prope flumina Mellae ) flows about a mile to the westward of Brixia.

mater: Brixia is nowhere else called the mother-city of Verona, though some writers speak of Verona as a Gallic town; cf. Ptol. 3.1.27; Just. 20.5.8; not so, perhaps, Livy (Liv. 5.35.1), nor, certainly, Pliny (Plin. NH 3.130).

The two men, evidently inhabitants of Brixia, are otherwise unknown.

37-40. A remark of the Door itself, which, having been fairly started on its story by v. 18, continues it to the end, preferring to anticipate rather than to await criticism.

dixerit aliquis: see Roby (Lat. Gram. vol. 2. Pref.), who thinks the verb in this construction probably indicative.

tigillo: the lintel, not the jamb, as suffixa sufficiently indicates. The ancient door, like some heavier specimens of modern make, swung on two vertical pivots fitting into sockets near the extremity of lintel and sill respectively.

tollat supercilia: sc. in anger; cf. Schol. on Ar. Vesp. 655 τὰς ὀφρῦς αἴρειν ἔθος τοῖς ὀργιζομένοις .

rubra: perhaps not of the color of the brows, as a mark of identification, but of the flush of anger on the forehead: the hints toward identification follow later.

longus: tall; as in Catul. 86.1 longa .

magnas cui: etc. i. e. he had been sued on a charge of bastardy (though the expected birth finally did not take place), and the case had been a noteworthy (magnas) one.[^b4e8e9e18be44f148150b3a43c0c0971]

### A story by Cornelius Tacitus about Mutina from Historiae



Hostilities had ceased everywhere, but a considerable number of the Senate, who had accompanied Otho from Rome, and had been afterwards left at Mutina, encountered the utmost peril. News of the defeat was brought to this place. The soldiers, however, rejected it as a false report; and judging the Senate to be hostile to Otho, watched their language, and put an unfavourable construction on their looks and manner. Proceeding at last to abuse and insults, they sought a pretext for beginning a massacre, while a different anxiety also weighed upon the Senators, who, knowing that the party of Vitellius was in the ascendant, feared that they might seem to have been tardy in welcoming the conqueror. Thus they met in great alarm and distracted by a twofold apprehension; no one was ready with any advice of his own, but looked for safety in sharing any mistake with many others. The anxieties of the terrified assembly were aggravated when the Senate of Mutina made them an offer of arms and money, and, with an ill-timed compliment, styled them "Conscript Fathers."[^a09fb85ef1df4a70ab78d2e709ba1950]

And I notice, O conscript fathers, that there are some who favor this proposal: whose intention and design is, as they see that that will be a most glorious day for Decimus Brutus on which we return to our usual dress out of joy for his safety, to deprive him of this great reward, so that it may not be handed down to the recollection of posterity that the Roman people had recourse to the garb of war on account of the danger of one single citizen, and then returned to their gowns of pence on account of his safety. Take away this reason, and you will find no other for so absurd a proposal. But do you, O conscript fathers, preserve your authority, adhere to your own opinions, preserve in your recollection what you have often declared, that the whole result of this entire war depends on the life of one most brave and excellent man.[^c05d5bc743974ef2832a4244d9fc510e]

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Thus spake the hag  
And through redoubled night, a squalid veil  
Swathing her pallid features, stole among  
Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves,  
The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied  
Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step  
She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh  
As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs  
Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung  
The fates of slain unnumbered; had she striven  
Armies to raise and order back to life  
Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed  
Of Erebus; and, summoned up from Styx,  
Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call,  
And rising fought once more. At length the witch  
Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape  
Fit for her purpose. Gripped by pitiless hook  
O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave  
Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore  
The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink  
The land that girds the precipice of hell  
Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves  
A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew  
Casts shade impenetrable. Foul decay  
Fills all the space, and in the deep recess  
Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells,  
Reigns ever. Not where gape the misty jaws  
Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound  
Of either world, through which the nether kings  
Permit the passage of the dead to earth,  
So poisonous, mephitic, hangs the air.  
Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades  
Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave  
Were not a part of hell. Discordant hues  
Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn;  
Bare was her visage, and upon her brow  
Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks  
In sable coils entwined. But when she saw  
The youth's companions trembling, and himself  
With eyes cast down, with visage as of death,  
Thus spake the witch: ' Forbid your craven souls  
'These fears to cherish: soon returning life  
'This frame shall quicken, and in tones which reach  
Even the timorous ear shall speak the man.  
'If I have power the Stygian lakes to show,  
The bank that sounds with fire, the fury band,  
'And giants fettered, and the hound that shakes  
'Bristling with heads of snakes his triple head,  
What fear is this that cringes at the sight  
Of timid shivering shades? '  
Then to her prayer.  
First through his gaping bosom blood she pours  
Still fervent, washing from his wounds the gore.  
Then copious poisons from the moon distils  
Mixed with all monstrous things which Nature's pangs  
Bring to untimely birth; the froth from dogs  
Stricken with madness, foaming at the stream;  
A lynx's entrails: and the knot that grows  
Upon the fell hyaena; flesh of stags  
Fed upon serpents; and the sucking fish  
Which holds the vessel back^[One of the miraculous stories to be found in Pliny's 'Natural History.' See Lecky's 'Augustus to Charlemagne,' vol. i., p. 370.] though eastern winds  
Make bend the canvas; dragon's eyes; and stones  
That sound beneath the brooding eagle's wings.  
Nor Araby's viper, nor the ocean snake  
Who in the Red Sea waters guards the shell,  
Are wanting; nor the slough on Libyan sands  
By horned reptile cast; nor ashes fail  
Snatched from an altar where the Phoenix died.  
And viler poisons many, which herself  
Has made, she adds, whereto no name is given:  
Pestiferous leaves pregnant with magic chants  
And blades of grass which in their primal growth  
Her cursed mouth had slimed. Last came her voice  
More potent than all herbs to charm the gods  
Who rule in Lethe. Dissonant murmurs first  
And sounds discordant from the tongues of men  
She utters, scarce articulate: the bay  
Of wolves, and barking as of dogs, were mixed  
With that fell chant; the screech of nightly owl  
Raising her hoarse complaint; the howl of beast  
And sibilant hiss of snake-all these were there;  
And more-the wail of waters on the rock,  
The sound of forests and the thunder peal.  
Such was her voice; but soon in clearer tones  
Reaching to Tartarus, she raised her song:  
' Ye awful goddesses, avenging power  
' Of Hell upon the damned, and Chaos huge  
' Who striv'st to mix innumerable worlds,  
' And Pluto, king of earth, whose weary soul  
' Grieves at his godhead; Styx; and plains of bliss  
' We may not enter: and thou, Proserpine,  
' Hating thy mother and the skies above,  
' My patron goddess, last and lowest form^[The mysterious goddess Hecate was identified with Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Proserpine in the lower regions. The text is doubtful.]  
' Of Hecate, through whom the shades and I  
' Hold silent converse; warder of the gate  
' Who castest human offal to the dog:  
' Ye sisters who shall spin the threads again;^[That is, for the second life of her victim.]  
' And thou, O boatman of the burning wave,  
' Now wearied of the shades from hell to me  
' Returning, hear me if with voice I cry  
' Abhorred, polluted; if the flesh of man  
' Hath ne'er been absent from my proffered song,  
Flesh washed with brains still quivering; if the child  
Whose severed head I placed upon the dish  
But for this hand had lived-a listening ear  
Lend to my supplication! From the caves  
'Hid in the innermost recess of hell  
' I claim no soul long banished from the light.  
' For one but now departed, lingering still  
' Upon the brink of Orcus, is my prayer.  
Grant (for ye may) that listening to the spell  
'Once more he seek his dust; and let the shade  
Of this our soldier perished (if the war  
Well at your hands has merited), proclaim  
The destiny of Magnus to his son.'  
Such prayers she uttered; then upraised her head  
And foaming lips, and present saw the ghost.  
Hard by he stood, beside the hated corpse  
His ancient prison, and loathed to enter in.  
There was the yawning chest where fell the blow  
That was his death; and yet the gift supreme  
Of death, his right, (Ah, wretch! ) was reft away.  
Angered at Death the witch, and at the pause  
Conceded by the fates, with living snake  
Scourges the nerveless corse; and on the dead  
She barks through fissures gaping to her song,  
Breaking the silence of their gloomy home:  
' Tisiphone, Megaera, heed ye not?  
Flies not this wretched soul before your whips  
' The void of Erebus? By your very names,  
' She-dogs of hell, I'll call you to the day,  
Not to return; through sepulchres and death  
Your gaoler: from funereal urns and tombs  
I'll chase you forth. And thou, too, Hecate,  
Who to the gods in comely shape and mien,  
Not that of Erebus, appear'st, henceforth  
Wasted and pallid as thou art in hell  
'At my command shalt come. I'll noise abroad  
The banquet that beneath the solid earth  
Holds thee, thou maid of Enna; by what bond  
'Thou lov'st night's King, by what mysterious stain  
Infected, so that Ceres fears from hell  
'To call her daughter. And for thee, base king,  
'Titan shall pierce thy caverns with his rays  
And sudden day shall smite thee. Do ye hear?  
'Or shall I summon to mine aid that god  
'At whose dread name earth trembles; who can look  
Unflinching on the Gorgon's head, and drive  
'The Furies with his scourge, who holds the depths  
' Ye cannot fathom, and above whose haunts  
Ye dwell supernal; who by waves of Styx  
Forswears himself unpunished? '

### A story by Lucan, 39-65 about Luna from Civil War



  
Thus spake the hag  
And through redoubled night, a squalid veil  
Swathing her pallid features, stole among  
Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves,  
The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied  
Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step  
She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh  
As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs  
Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung  
The fates of slain unnumbered; had she striven  
Armies to raise and order back to life  
Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed  
Of Erebus; and, summoned up from Styx,  
Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call,  
And rising fought once more. At length the witch  
Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape  
Fit for her purpose. Gripped by pitiless hook  
O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave  
Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore  
The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink  
The land that girds the precipice of hell  
Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves  
A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew  
Casts shade impenetrable. Foul decay  
Fills all the space, and in the deep recess  
Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells,  
Reigns ever. Not where gape the misty jaws  
Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound  
Of either world, through which the nether kings  
Permit the passage of the dead to earth,  
So poisonous, mephitic, hangs the air.  
Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades  
Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave  
Were not a part of hell. Discordant hues  
Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn;  
Bare was her visage, and upon her brow  
Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks  
In sable coils entwined. But when she saw  
The youth's companions trembling, and himself  
With eyes cast down, with visage as of death,

Virgil departed from Luna, intending to travel by ship, down the coast to Genua, a 76.070101933 mile journey. 

### A story by Suetonius ca. 69-ca. 122 about Genua from Divus Claudius



He undertook only one expedition, and that was of short duration. The triumphal ornaments decreed him by the senate, he considered as beneath the imperial dignity, and was therefore resolved to have the honour of a real triumph. For this purpose, he selected Britain, which had never been attempted by any one since Julius Caesar,^[Opposed to this statement there is a passage in Servius Georgius, iii. 33, asserting that he had heard (accipimus) that Augustus, besides his victories in the east, triumphed over the Britons in the west; and Horace says:- Augustus adjectis Britannis Imperio gravibusque Persis. Ode iii. 5, 1. Strabo likewise informs us, that in his time, the petty British kings sent embassies to cultivate the alliance of Augustus, and make offerings in the Capitol: and that nearly the whole island was on terms of amity with the Romans, and, as well as the Gauls, paid a light tribute.-Strabo, B. iv. p. 138. That Augustus contemplated a descent on the island, but was prevented from attempting it by his being recalled from Gaul by the disturbances in Dalmatia, is very probable. Horace offers his vows for its success: Serves iturum, Caesarum in ultimos Orbis Britannos. Ode i. 35. But the word iturus shews that the scheme was only projected, and the lines previously quoted are mere poetical flattery. Strabo's statement of the communications kept up with the petty kings of Britain, who were perhaps divided by intestine wars, are, to a certain extent, probably correct, as such a policy would be a prelude to the intended expedition. ] and was then chafing with rage, because the Romans would not give up some deserters. Accordingly, he set sail from Ostia, but was twice very near being wrecked by the boisterous wind called Circius,^[Circius. Aulus Gellius, Seneca, and Pliny, mention under this name the strong southerly gales which prevail in the gulf of Genoa and the neighbouring seas. ] upon the coast of Liguria, near the islands called Stoechades.^[The Stoechades were the islands now called Hieres, off Toulon. ] Having marched by land from Marseilles to Gessoriacum,^[Claudius must have expended more time in his march from Marseilles to Gessoriacum, as Boulogne was then called, than in his vaunted conquest of Britain. ] he thence passed over to Britain, and part of the island submitting to him, within a few days after his arrival, without battle or bloodshed, he returned to Rome in less than six months from the time of his departure, and triumphed in the most solemn manner;^[In point of fact, he was only sixteen days in the island, receiving the submission of some tribes in the south-eastern districts. But the way had been prepared for him by his able general, Aulus Plautius, who defeated Cunobeline, and made himself master of his capital, Camulodunum, or Colchester. These successes were followed up by Ostorius, who conquered Caractacus and sent him to Rome. It is singular that Suetonius has supplied us with no particulars of these events. Some account of them is given in the disquisition appended to this life of Caligula. The expedition of Plautius took place A. U. C. 796, A D. 44. ] to witness which, he not only gave leave to governors of provinces to come to Rome, but even to some of the exiles. Among the spoils taken from the enemy, he fixed upon the pediment of his house in the Palatium, a naval crown, in token of his having passed, and, as it were, conquered the Ocean, and had it suspended near the civic crown which was there before. Messalina, his wife, followed his chariot in a covered litter.^[Carpentum: see note in CALIGULA, c. xv. ] Those who had attained the honour of triumphal ornaments in the same war, rode behind; the rest followed on foot, wearing the robe with the broad stripes. Crassus Frugi was mounted upon a horse richly caparisoned, in a robe embroidered with palm leaves, because this was the second time of his obtaining that honour.

In point of fact, he was only sixteen days in the island, receiving the submission of some tribes in the south-eastern districts. But the way had been prepared for him by his able general, Aulus Plautius, who defeated Cunobeline, and made himself master of his capital, Camulodunum, or Colchester.
