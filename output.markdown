## Introduction
It has long been a common practice to incorporate the works of earlier writers into new books. Indeed, many commonplace books consist of nothing _but_ quotations and similar notes. We have many surviving examples from the Roman Empire, such as Aulus Gellius' _Attic Nights_. These texts were not always attributed to the original source. Lacking the modern concept of plagiarism (and our post-printing-press system of uniform citations) writers sometimes come off as careless to modern sensibilities. Quotes could be paraphrased and rather vague citations were the norm. Indeed, some authors committed a kind of reverse plagiarism, [pseudepigraphically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigrapha) attributing their work to an earlier, more famous author.
 
In a way, this reuse is fortunate: many texts from the Classical period only exist in fragments quoted in other documents. Some works survive in [epitome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome), distilled versions that summarized the text; for others we have fragments that later writers quoted or abridged as they wrote their compilations.

Artists, of course, have been far looser with their borrowings than writers of mere facts, placing the present work solidly within a long tradition. The closest literary ancedents of NaNoGenMo--Dada and Oulipo--have often explored similar sampling approaches. Kathryn Hume has suggested that technical constratints have lead NaNoGenMo to "align itself with poetics of recontextualization and reassembly." While I'd point out that NaNoGenMo also exhibits other aspects, such as the concrete poetry in thricedotted's _The Seeker_, or the way structurally-plotted works like _Hannah and The Twelve-Disk Tower of Hanoi_ evoke the chessboard constraints of _Life a User's Manual_ or _Through the Looking Glass_, there is an undeniable strand of appropreation as we teach our machines to imitate their human creators. Still, that's no reason to neglect giving credit, so this book attempts to cite the sources for the texts it borrows.

In this work, that deliberate borrowing is the intent. Unlike an age of precious codices, the information age is a time of entirely too much to read. Search engines can find anything you ask for but, like a fairy-tale mirror, can only answer the questions you know enough to ask in the first place. The serendipity of browsing through a library is lost. Extracting the stories and arranging them in a new pattern presents a new angle. Rather than an exhaustive view of the forest, it picks out one or two trees you might have otherwise overlooked.

I chose Virgil as the protagonist for three reasons: first, his works are among the source texts in the Perseus Digital Library used for much of the text here. His epic built on the earlier traditions, appropriate for a work themed around appropriation and reuse. This would not be enough to recommend him on its own: there are other authors whose works were much closer to the kind of copying and summarizing going on here. But there was also a tradition that linked Virgil and his poetry with magic and prophecy. It was no accident that Dante chose Virgil to be his guide through the _Inferno_. Lastly, that tradition of magic lead the much-neglected Avram Davidson to pen a novel with Vergil Magus as the magician-protagonist. My own pseudo-Virgil is a humble tribute, a machine homunculus librarian to forgotten texts.

### A story about Roma



There^[The Combat of the Horatii and Curiatii.] happened to be in each of the armies a triplet of brothers, fairly matched in years and strength. It is generally agreed that they were called Horatii and Curiatii. Few incidents in antiquity have been more widely celebrated, yet in spite of its celebrity there is a discrepancy in the accounts as to which nation each belonged. There are authorities on both sides, but I find that the majority give the name of Horatii to the Romans, and my sympathies lead me to follow them.

The kings suggested to them that they should each fight on behalf of their country, and where victory rested, there should be the sovereignty. They raised no objection; so the time and place were fixed. But before they engaged a treaty was concluded between the Romans and the Albans, providing that the nation whose representatives proved victorious should receive the peaceable submission of the other.

This is the earliest treaty recorded, and as all treaties, however different the conditions they contain, are concluded with the same forms, I will describe the forms with which this one was concluded as handed down by tradition. The Fetial put the formal question to Tullus: Do you, King, order me to make a treaty with the Pater Patratus of the Alban nation? On the king replying in the affirmative, the Fetial said: I demand of thee, King, some tufts of grass. The king replied: Take those that are pure. The Fetial brought pure grass from the Citadel. Then he asked the king: Do you constitute me the plenipotentiary of the People of Rome, the Quirites, sanctioning also my vessels and comrades? To which the king replied: So far as may be without hurt to myself and the People of Rome, the Quirites, I do. The Fetial was M. Valerius. He made Spurius Furius the Pater Patratus by touching his head and hair with the grass. Then the Pater Patratus, who is constituted for the purpose of giving the treaty the religious sanction of an oath, did so by a long formula in verse, which it is not worth while to quote. After reciting the conditions he said: Hear, 0 Jupiter, hear! thou Pater Patratus of the people of Alba! Hear ye, too, people of Alba! As these conditions have been publicly rehearsed from first to last, from these tablets, in perfect good faith, and inasmuch as they have here and now been most clearly understood, so these conditions the People of Rome will not be the first to go back from. If they shall, in their national council, with false and malicious intent be the first to go back, then do thou, Jupiter, on that day, so smite the People of Rome, even as I here and now shall smite this swine, and smite them so much the more heavily, as thou art greater in power and might. With these words he struck the swine with a flint. In similar wise the Albans recited their oath and formularies through their own dictator and their priests.[^114f0b1c730948318b62482f3d88d822]

### A story about Roma



It was in the nineteenth year after the sea-fight at^[B. C. 387-386. The rise of the Roman dominion may be traced from the retirement of the Gauls from the city. From that time one nation after another in Italy fell into their hands.] Aegospotami, and the sixteenth before the battle at Leuctra; the year in which the Lacedaemonians made what is called the Peace of Antalcidas with the King of Persia; the year in which the elder Dionysius was besieging Rhegium after beating the Italian Greeks on the river Elleporus; and in which the Gauls took Rome itself by storm and were occupying the whole of it except the Capitol. With these Gauls the Romans made a treaty and settlement which they were content to accept: and having thus become beyond all expectation once more masters of their own country, they made a start in their career of expansion; and in the succeeding period engaged in various wars with their neighbours.^[The Latini.] First, by dint of valour, and the good fortune which attended them in the field, they mastered all the Latini; then they went to war with the Etruscans; then with the Celts; and next with the Samnites, who lived on the eastern and northern frontiers of Latium.^[The Etruscans, Gauls, and Samnites.] Some time after this the Tarentines insulted the ambassadors of Rome, and, in fear of the consequences, invited and obtained the assistance of Pyrrhus.^[Pyrrhus, B. C. 280.] This happened in the year before the Gauls invaded Greece, some of whom perished near Delphi, while others crossed into Asia. Then it was that the Romans—having reduced the Etruscans and Samnites to obedience, and conquered the Italian Celts in many battles—attempted for the first time the reduction of the rest of Italy.^[Southern Italy.] The nations for whose possessions they were about to fight they affected to regard, not in the light of foreigners, but as already for the most part belonging and pertaining to themselves. The experience gained from their contests with the Samnites and the Celts had served as a genuine training in the art of war.^[Pyrrhus finally quits Italy, B. C. 274.] Accordingly, they entered upon the war with spirit, drove Pyrrhus from Italy, and then undertook to fight with and subdue those who had taken part with him. They succeeded everywhere to a marvel, and reduced to obedience all the tribes inhabiting Italy except the Celts; after which they undertook to besiege some of their own citizens, who at that time were occupying Rhegium.[^ec2b56bb6a5e454caa9829dfa0465aaf]

Virgil departed from Roma, intending to travel by road to Tibur, a 17.629538012 mile journey. 

### A story about Tibur



After this one would naturally be inclined to ask what part is left for the people in the constitution, when the Senate has these various functions, especially the control of the receipts and expenditure of the exchequer; and when the Consuls, again, have absolute power over the details of military preparation, and an absolute authority in the field? There is, however, a part left the people, and it is a most important one. For the people is the sole fountain of honour and of punishment; and it is by these two things and these alone that dynasties and constitutions and, in a word, human society are held together: for where the distinction between them is not sharply drawn both in theory and practice, there no undertaking can be properly administered,—as indeed we might expect when good and bad are held in exactly the same honour. The people then are the only court to decide matters of life and death; and even in-cases where the penalty is money, if the sum to be assessed is sufficiently serious, and especially when the accused have held the higher magistracies. And in regard to this arrangement there is one point deserving especial commendation and record. Men who are on trial for their lives at Rome, while sentence is in process of being voted,—if even only one of the tribes whose votes are needed to ratify the sentence has not voted,—have the privilege at Rome of openly departing and condemning themselves to a voluntary exile. Such men are safe at Naples or Praeneste or at Tibur, and at other towns with which this arrangement has been duly ratified on oath.

Again, it is the people who bestow offices on the deserving, which are the most honourable rewards of virtue. It has also the absolute power of passing or repealing laws; and, most important of all, it is the people who deliberate on the question of peace or war. And when provisional terms are made for alliance, suspension of hostilities, or treaties, it is the people who ratify them or the reverse.

These considerations again would lead one to say that the chief power in the state was the people's, and that the constitution was a democracy.[^6392504e0b8644cf8bea3a7f6ae0ecd2]

### A story about Tibur



A solemn custom was observ'd of old,  
Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,  
Their standard when in fighting fields they rear  
Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare  
The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;  
Or from the boasting Parthians would regain  
Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.  
Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,  
And still are worship'd with religious fear)  
Before his temple stand: the dire abode,  
And the fear'd issues of the furious god,  
Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,  
The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.  
Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,  
The Roman consul their decree declares,  
And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.  
The youth in military shouts arise,  
And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.  
These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,  
Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,  
Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar  
Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;  
But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,  
Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.  
Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:  
At her approach the brazen hinges fly;  
The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;  
And, like a tempest, issues out the war.  
  
The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,  
Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,  
Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,  
Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;  
Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,  
And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry.  
Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part  
New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:  
With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,  
And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.  
Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,  
Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,  
Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:  
All these of old were places of renown.  
Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;  
Some twine young sallows to support the shield;  
The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold,  
With silver plated, and with ductile gold.  
The rustic honors of the scythe and share  
Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.  
Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires;  
The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.  
The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace  
The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.  
The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;  
The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.

### A story about Tibur



He completed the works which were left unfinished by Tiberius, namely, the temple of Augustus, and the theatre of Pompey.^[See TIBERIUS, c. xlvii. and AUGUSTUS, c. xxxi.] He began, likewise, the aqueduct from the neighbourhood of Tibur,^[This aqueduct, commenced by Caligula and completed by Claudian, a truly imperial work, conveyed the waters of two streams to Rome, following the valley of the Anio from above Tivoli. The course of one of these rivulets was forty miles, and it was carried on arches, immediately after quitting its source, for a distance of three miles. The other, the Anio Novus, also began on arches, which continued for upwards of twelve miles. After this, both were conveyed under ground; but at the distance of six miles from the city, they were united, and carried upon arches all the rest of the way. This is the most perfect of all the ancient aqueducts; and it has been repaired, so as to convey the Acqua Felice, one of the three streams which now supply Rome. See CLAUDIUS, c. XX. ] and an amphitheatre near the Septa;^[By Septa, Suetonius here means the huts or barracks of the pretorian camp, which was a permanent and fortified station. It stood to the east of the Viminal and Quirinal hills, between the present Porta Pia and S. Lorenzo, where these is a quadrangular projection in the city walls marking the site. The remains of the Amphitheatrum Castrense stand between the Porta Maggiore and S. Giovanni, formerly without the ancient walls, but now included in the line. It is all of brick, even the Corinthian pillars, and seems to have been but a rude structure, suited to the purpose for which it was built, the amusement of the soldiers, and gymnastic exercises. For this purpose they were used to construct temporary amphitheatres near the stations in the distant provinces, which were not built of stone or brick, but hollow circular spots dug in the ground, round which the spectators sat on the declivity, on ranges of seats cut in the sod. Many vestiges of this kind have been traced in Britain. ] of which works, one was completed by his successor Claudius, and the other remained as he left it. The walls of Syracuse, which had fallen to decay by length of time, he repaired, as he likewise did the temples of the gods. He formed plans for rebuilding the palace of Polycrates at Samos, finishing the temple of the Didymaean Apollo at Miletus, and building a town on a ridge of the Alps; but, above all, for cutting through the isthmus in Achaia^[The Isthmus of Corinth; an enterprize which had formerly been attempted by Demetrius, and which was also projected by Julius Caesar, c. xliv., and Nero, c. xix.; but they all failed of accomplishing it.] and even sent a centurion of the first rank to measure out the work.[^6286dba90ba94148ab875ae92eb5e71b]

### A story about Roma



When, after his final defeat by the Romans, Hannibal had at last quitted his country and was staying at the court of Antiochus, the warlike attitude of the Aetolian league induced the Romans to send ambassadors to Antiochus, that they might be informed of the king's intentions.^[B. C. 195]These ambassadors found that Antiochus was inclined to the Aetolian alliance, and was eager for war with Rome; they accordingly paid great court to Hannibal with a view of bringing him into suspicion with the king. And in this they entirely succeeded. As time went on the king became ever more and more suspicious of Hannibal, until at length an opportunity occurred for an explanation of the alienation that had been thus secretly growing up between them.^[B. C. 238.] Hannibal then defended himself at great length, but without success, until at last he made the following statement: "When my father was about to go on his Iberian expedition I was nine years old: and as he was offering the sacrifice to Zeus I stood near the altar. The sacrifice successfully performed, my father poured the libation and went through the usual ritual. He then bade all the other worshippers stand a little back, and calling me to him asked me affectionately whether I wished to go with him on his expedition. Upon my eagerly assenting, and begging with boyish enthusiasm to be allowed to go, he took me by the right hand and led me up to the altar, and bade me lay my hand upon the victim and swear that I would never be friends with Rome. So long, then, Antiochus, as your policy is one of hostility to Rome, you may feel quite secure of having in me a most thoroughgoing supporter. But if ever you make terms or friendship with her, then you need not wait for any slander to make you distrust me and be on your guard against me; for there is nothing in my power that I would not do against her."[^f0069b5299c84d6b9cbf490934276f97]

### A story about Tibur



Marcus Lepidus is desirous of peace. He does well especially if he can make such a peace as he made lately, owing to which the republic will behold the son of Cnaeus Pompeius, and will receive him in her bosom and embrace; and will think, that not he alone, but that she also is restored to herself with him. This was the reason why you decreed to him a statue in the rostra with an honorable inscription, and why you voted him a triumph in his absence. For although he had performed great exploits in war, and such as well deserved a triumph, still for that he might not have had that given to him which was not given to Lucius Aemilius, nor to Aemilianus Scipio, nor to the former Africanus, nor to Marius, nor to Pompeius, who had the conduct of greater wars than he had, but because he had put an end to a civil war in perfect silence, the first moment that it was in his power, on that account you conferred on him the greatest honors.[^47c7cf4fcd6e46a7a8bf51efe2a7d0d2]

### A story about Corfinium



Having dismissed him with these instructions, he arrived before Brundusium with six legions, three of which were composed of veteran soldiers, and the rest of new levies drawn together upon his march; for as to Domitius's troops, he had sent them directly from Corfinium to Sicily. He found the consuls were gone to Dyrrhachium with great part of the army, and that Pompey remained in Brundusium with twenty cohorts. Nor was it certainly known whether he continued there with design to keep possession of Brundusium, that he might be master of the whole Adriatic Sea, the extreme parts of Italy, and the country of Greece, in order to make war on both sides the gulf; or for want of shipping to transport his men. Fearing, therefore, that it was his intention to keep footing in Italy he resolved to deprive him of the advantages he might receive from the port of Brundusium. The works he contrived for this purpose were as follows: He carried on a mole on either side the mouth of the haven where the entrance was narrowest, and the water shallow. But as this work could not be carried quite across the port, by reason of the great depth of the sea, he prepared double floats of timber, thirty feet square, which were each secured by four anchors from the four corners, to enable them to resist the fury of the waves. These, extending all the way between the two moles, were covered over with earth and fascines, that the soldiers might pass and repass with ease, and have firm footing to defend them. The front and sides were armed with a parapet of hurdies, and every fourth float had a tower of two stories, the better to guard the work from fire and the shocks of the vessels.[^1b0e4b098dfa45968894278feef530d9]

Caesar having made himself master of Asculum, and obliged Lentulus to retire, ordered the soldiers who had deserted him, to be sought after, and new levies to be made. He remained only one day there, to settle what related to provisions, and then pursued his march to Corfinium. Upon his arrival there, he found five cohorts, whom Domitius had detached from the garrison, employed in breaking down a bridge about three miles distant from the town. But Caesar's advanced parties attacking them, they quickly abandoned the bridge, and retired to Corfinium. Caesar having passed with his legions, halted before the town, and encamped under the walls.[^478b223eddac412796418d684aa29448]

Oppianicus began to entreat the man to show him some method of corrupting the tribunal But he, as was afterwards heard from Oppianicus himself, said that there was no one in the city except himself who could do this. But at first he began to make objections, because he said that he was a candidate for the aedileship with men of the highest rank, and that he was afraid of incurring unpopularity and of giving offence. Afterwards, being prevailed on, he required at first a large sum of money. At last, he came down to what could be managed, and desired six hundred and forty thousand sesterces to be sent to his house. And as soon as this money was brought to him, that most worthless man immediately began to form and adopt the following idea,—that nothing could be more advantageous for his interests than for Oppianicus to be condemned; because, if he were acquitted, he must either distribute the money among the judges, or else restore it to him: but if he were condemned, there would be no one to reclaim it.[^f57da1fc01924a0e8215f81014068ec4]
