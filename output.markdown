% Virgil's Commonplace Book
% Isaac Karth

## Introduction
It has long been a common practice to incorporate the works of earlier writers into new books. Indeed, many commonplace books consist of nothing _but_ quotations and similar notes. We have many surviving examples from the Roman Empire, such as Aulus Gellius' _Attic Nights_. These texts were not always attributed to the original source. Lacking the modern concept of plagiarism (and our post-printing-press system of uniform citations) writers sometimes come off as careless to modern sensibilities. Quotes could be paraphrased and rather vague citations were the norm. Indeed, some authors committed a kind of reverse plagiarism, [pseudepigraphically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigrapha) attributing their work to an earlier, more famous author.
 
In a way, this reuse is fortunate: many texts from the Classical period only exist in fragments quoted in other documents. Some works survive in [epitome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome), distilled versions that summarized the text; for others we have fragments that later writers quoted or abridged as they wrote their compilations.

Artists, of course, have been far looser with their borrowings than writers of mere facts, placing the present work solidly within a long tradition. The closest literary ancedents of NaNoGenMo--Dada and Oulipo--have often explored similar sampling approaches. Kathryn Hume has suggested that technical constratints have lead NaNoGenMo to "align itself with poetics of recontextualization and reassembly."^[Hume, Kathryn. "NaNoGenMo: Dada 2.0". URL:\url{http://arcade.stanford.edu/blogs/nanogenmo-dada-20}. Accessed: 2015-11-28. (Archived by WebCiteÂ® at \url{http://www.webcitation.org/6dNl9xpbY})] 

NaNoGenMo has included other approaches, such as the concrete poetry in thricedotted's _The Seeker_, or the way structurally-plotted works like _Hannah and The Twelve-Disk Tower of Hanoi_ evoke the chessboard constraints of _Life a User's Manual_ or _Through the Looking Glass_. But there is an undeniable strand of appropreation as we teach our machines to imitate their human creators. Still, that's no reason to neglect giving credit, so this book attempts to cite the sources for the texts it borrows.

In this work, that deliberate borrowing is the intent. Unlike an age of precious codices, the information age is a time of entirely too much to read. Search engines can find anything you ask for but, like a fairy-tale mirror, can only answer the questions you know enough to ask in the first place. The serendipity of browsing through a library is lost. Extracting the stories and arranging them in a new pattern presents a new angle. Rather than an exhaustive view of the forest, it picks out one or two trees you might have otherwise overlooked.

I chose Virgil as the protagonist for three reasons: first, his works are among the source texts in the Perseus Digital Library used for much of the text here. His _Aeneid_ builds on earlier traditions, recast in a founding epic for a new age: appropriate for a work themed around appropriation and reuse in this new information age. This would not be enough to recommend him on its own: there are other authors whose works were much closer to the kind of copying and summarizing going on here. And _The Golden Ass_ by Apuleius, one of the earliest surviving novels, is closer in form to the travel tale that structures this generated novel. 

But there was also a tradition that linked Virgil and his poetry with magic and prophecy. It was no accident that Dante chose Virgil to be his guide through the _Inferno_. His memory is haunted by that touch of magic, a magic intimately linked with words and poetry. And, as Jeff Howard has pointed out,^[in _Game Magic: A Designer's Guide to Magic Systems in Theory and Practice_] programming is a form of magic. A magician-protagonist is entirely appropreate.

Lastly, that tradition of magic lead the much-neglected Avram Davidson to pen a novel with Vergil Magus as the magician-protagonist. My own pseudo-Virgil is a humble tribute, a machine homunculus librarian of forgotten texts.

## Travelling by road

Virgil departed from Ocriculum, intending to travel by road to Narnia, a journey of about 8 miles. 

A grove of Minerva is hard by the road, a grove of poplar trees. Now the road is quieter. As they go up from Ocriculum, they see the ruined walls. Water has washed out the road, making for slow going. He left the city early, before the rising of the sun.

## To Spoletium

Intending to travel by road to Spoletium, Virgil left Narnia. It was a distance of about 22 miles. 

A grove of Minerva is hard by the road, a grove of poplar trees. Above the roads are ruins, among which is a cave sacred to Asclepius. A caravan from Spoletium passed by. There is a fountain of cold water springing from the rock. The road narrows here, an orchard wall encroaching on it. Water has washed out the road, making for slow going. As they go up from Narnia, they see the ruined walls. He had set out from Narnia amidst a throng travelling the same way.

Intending to travel by road to Fanum Fortunae, Virgil left Spoletium. It was at least 90 miles. 

He left the city early, before the rising of the sun. A caravan from Fanum Fortunae passed by. A cloud passes in front of the sun. An oxcart passes, loaded with grain.

Stormclouds enwrap the day, and rainy gloom blots out the sky. Out of the clouds bursts fire fast upon fire. The sails drop; they swing back to the oars.   
  
For they care not for bow or quiver, but for masts and oars of ships. They care for the shapely ships, rejoicing in that which they cross over the grey sea.

# Iader To Reate
  
## 48 miles to Titius (river)

From Iader to Titius (river) is at least 48 miles when travelling by ship down the coast. 

The navigator professes he cannot tell day from night on the sky, nor remember the way amid the waters. Clouds the darkened heavens have drowned, and snatched the daylight from their eyes. Black night broods on the waters. Even as he cried, the hurricane from the North struck with a roar against the sailThe shattered oars start forth. The oars are snapped. The yawning billow shows ground amid the surge, where the sea churns with sand. They hang on the wave's ridge. Piteous to see, it dashes on shoals and girdles with a sandbank.   
  
The sails drop; they swing back to the oars.   
  
Towards the deep doth stand an island, on whose jutting headlands beat the broken billows, shivered into sleet. Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene appears above, and groves for ever green. Glad at length to greet the welcome earth, the sailors leap to land.

Straightway the winds upturn the main, and great seas rise. Driven from our course, we go wandering on the blind waves. They sweep through the green water.

Straightway the winds upturn the main, and great seas rise. Driven from our course, we go wandering on the blind waves. Black night broods on the waters. A gust of the shrill north strikes full on the sail and raises the waves up to heaven. Up leaped the waves to heaven. The prow swings away and gives her side to the waves. The yawning billow shows ground amid the surge, where the sea churns with sand. They are in the wave's huge hollow. Piteous to see, it dashes on shoals and girdles with a sandbank. Before their eyes a vast sea descending strikes astern. Scattered swimmers appear in the vast eddy; armour of men, timbers and treasure amid the water.   
  
The sails drop; they swing back to the oars.   
  
Towards the deep doth stand an island, on whose jutting headlands beat the broken billows, shivered into sleet. The waters at their feet sleep hushed, and, like a curtain, frowns above, mixt with the glancing green, the darkness of the grove. A grotto is formed beneath, with mossy seats, to rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats. Down through the crannies of the living walls the crystal streams descend in murmuring falls. The sailors, worn with toils, and spent with woes, leap on the welcome land, and seek their wished-for repose. They lay their weary limbs still dripping on the sand.

## The journey to Altinum

Intending to travel by ship down the coast to Altinum, Virgil left Brundulum. It was a distance of about 27 miles. 

They spread their sails and ran over the waste sea in their hollow wood. The breezes woo the sails, and the canvas blows out to the swelling south.   
  
Driven from our course, we go wandering on the blind waves. Dubious days of blind darkness we wander on the deep, nights without a star. Without delay the sailors strongly toss up the foam.   
  
For they care not for bow or quiver, but for masts and oars of ships. They care for the shapely ships, rejoicing in that which they cross over the grey sea.
